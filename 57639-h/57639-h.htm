<div class="chapter padt1">
<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2></div>

<p>The owner of a great tannery had once an improvement in
making leather proposed to him by a foreman, but the merchant
could not comprehend it even with the most earnest
verbal explanation. As a last resort he said, “put it in writing
so that I can study it out.” This was done and the change
after an examination of the paper was made as advised. So
in these volumes much important information is written and
printed that it may be “studied out.”</p>

<p>The author believes the following features of his work
adapt it to the purpose for which it was designed:</p>

<p>1. It contains no more than can be mastered by the average
engineer and those associated with him, such as millwrights,
machinists, superintendents of motor power, electric stations,
water works, etc.</p>

<p>2. It is thoroughly systematized. The order and development
of subjects is thought to be logical, and the arrangement
of topics especially adapted to the needs of those who aspire
to do the best service in their every day responsibilities.</p>

<p>3. The work is written in accordance with modern theories
and practice; no exertion has been spared in the attempt to
make it fairly represent the latest state of the science of
hydraulics and its adaptation to the needs of modern mechanical
advancement, <em>i.e.</em>, in the line of practical hydraulics.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The preface is almost invariably made after the book itself is
finished, for an author never knows with much exactness whither his researches
will lead him. The book he begins is not always the book he
finished; this is especially the case with books relating to modern sciences
and industry. As an instance of this, it may be told that at the commencement
of this work it was generally agreed that the easy “lift” of the
centrifugal pump was some sixty or eighty feet, and not much more, but
the appropriate section relating to centrifugal pumps has reached a lift of
two thousand feet had been practically assured by recent discoveries. This
important difference demanded a change in the writing although—as it happened—not
in the printing. This, to explain why here, the author gives
generous praise to others who have assisted in the long task of making
these volumes.</p></div>

<p>4. It has been made by “men who know for men who
care,” for the whole circle of the sciences consists of principles
deduced from the discoveries of different individuals, in different
ages, thrown into common stock; this is especially so of the
science of hydraulics; thus it may be truthfully owned that
the work contains the gathered wisdom of the ages, utilized
wherever the author has found that it would increase the usefulness
of the volumes.</p>

<p>5. It is a work of reference minutely indexed. We are
warned by Prof. Karl Pearson that “education can only develope;
it cannot create. If a man has not inherited ability to
learn, education cannot make him learn,” but in a well indexed
book, simply and plainly written, both classes referred to are
equally benefited.</p>

<p>There came the moment, once upon a time, when the
author of this book, in his eager pursuit of knowledge, asked
one question too much, to which he received the “gruff”
answer:</p>

<p>“Look ahere, I don’t propose to make a dictionary of
myself.”</p>

<p>This was a painful retort from a man already under large
obligations to the questioner, but it had its reason in being
spoken. There are things in the way of a man’s own craft that
he most unwillingly imparts to anyone else.</p>

<p>It is not thus with this work; nothing has been withheld
that would make it plain and helpful to one in need of the
special line of information aimed to be conveyed in its make-up.</p>

<p>In making acknowledgment for favors received the author
first remembers Mr. Alberto H. Caffee who arranged in behalf
of the L. Middleditch Press for the issue of the work. Mr.
Caffee’s name appears in the dedication, with that of the brave

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Fig. <a href="#fig_330">330</a> is one of the simplest forms of an air pump. The description
accompanying Fig. <a href="#fig_341">341</a> properly applies to this one.</p></div>

<p><em>Air is the respirable fluid which
surrounds the earth and forms its
atmosphere.</em> It is inodorous, invisible,
insipid, colorless, elastic, possessed of
gravity, easily moved, rarefied and
condensed, essential to respiration
and combustion, and is the medium
of sound. It is composed by volume
of 20.7 parts of oxygen and 79.3 of
nitrogen, by weight, of 23 of oxygen
and 77 of nitrogen. These gases are not
chemically united, but are mixed mechanically. Air contains
also <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2000</sub> of carbon dioxide, some aqueous vapor, about
one per cent. of argon, and small varying amounts of ammonia,
nitric acid, ozone, and organic matter. The specific
gravity of the air at 32&deg; F is to that of water as 1 to 773, and
100 cubic inches of air at mean temperature and pressure weighs
30<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> grains.</p>

<p><em>A&euml;riform fluids are those which have the form of air.</em> Many
of them are invisible, or nearly so, and all of them perform very
important operations in the material world. But, notwithstanding
that they are in most instances imperceptible to our
sight, <em>they are really material, and possess all the essential
properties of matter</em>. They possess, also, in an eminent degree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
all the properties which have been ascribed to liquids in general,
besides others by which they are distinguished from liquids.</p>

<p><em>Elastic fluids are divided into two classes, namely, 1, permanent
gases and, 2, vapors.</em> The gases cannot be easily converted
into the liquid state by any known process of art;* but
the vapors are readily reduced to the liquid form either by
pressure or diminution of temperature. There is, however, no
essential difference between the mechanical properties of both
classes of fluids.</p>

<p>As the air which we breathe, and which surrounds us, is the
most familiar of all this class of bodies, it is generally selected
as the subject of Pneumatics. But it must be premised that
the same laws, properties and effects, which belong to air, belong
in common, also, to all a&euml;riform fluids or gaseous bodies.</p>

<p><em>There are two principal properties of air, namely, gravity
and elasticity.</em> These are called the principal properties of this
class of bodies, because they are the means by which their presence
and mechanical agency are especially exhibited.</p>

<p>Although the a&euml;riform fluids all have weight, they appear
to possess <em>no cohesive attraction</em>.</p>

<p>The pressure of the atmosphere caused by its weight is exerted
on all substances, internally and externally, and it is a
necessary consequence of its fluidity. When the external pressure
is artificially removed from any part, it is immediately felt
by the reaction of the internal air.</p>

<p>Heat insinuates itself between the particles of bodies and
forces them asunder, in opposition to the attraction of cohesion
and of gravity. It therefore exerts its power against both the
attraction of gravitation and the attraction of cohesion. But,
as the attraction of cohesion does not exist in a&euml;riform fluids,
<em>the expansive power of heat upon them has nothing to contend
with but gravity</em>. Hence, any increase of temperature, expands
an elastic fluid prodigiously, and a diminution of heat
condenses it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">*Note.</span>—Carbonic acid gas forms an exception to this assertion. Water
also is the union of oxygen and hydrogen gas.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>A column of air, having a base an inch square, and reaching
to the top of the atmosphere, weighs about fifteen pounds.
<em>This pressure, like the pressure of liquids, is exerted equally in
all directions.</em></p>

<p><em>The elasticity of air</em> and other a&euml;riform fluids is that property
by which they are increased or diminished in extension,
according as they are compressed. This property exists in a
much greater degree in air and other similar fluids than in any
other substance. In fact, it has no known limit, for, when the
pressure is removed from any portion of air, it immediately expands
to such a degree that the smallest quantity will diffuse
itself over an indefinitely large space. And, on the contrary,
when the pressure is increased, it will be compressed into indefinitely
small dimensions.</p>

<p>The elasticity or pressure of air and all gases is in direct
<em>proportion to their density</em>; or, what is the same thing, inversely
proportional to the space which the fluid occupies. This
law, which was discovered by Mariotte, is called “Mariotte’s
Law.” This law may perhaps be better expressed in the following
language; namely, the density of an elastic fluid is in direct
proportion to the pressure which it sustains.</p>

<p><em>Air becomes a mechanical agent by means of its weight, its
elasticity, its inertia and its fluidity.</em></p>

<p>The fluidity of air invests it, as it invests all other liquids,
with the power of transmitting pressure; fluidity is a necessary
consequence of the independent gravitation of the particles of
a fluid. It may, therefore, be included among the effects of
weight.</p>

<p>The inertia of air is exhibited in the resistance which it opposes
to motion, which has already been noticed under the head
of Mechanics. This is clearly seen in its effects upon falling
bodies, as will be exemplified in the experiments with the air-pump.</p>

<p><em>The great degree of elasticity</em> possessed by all a&euml;riform
fluids, renders them susceptible of compression and expansion
to an almost unlimited extent. The repulsion of their particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
causes them to expand, while within certain limits they are
easily compressed. This materially affects the state of density
and rarety under which they are at times exhibited.</p>

<p>It may here be stated that all the laws and properties of
liquids (described under the heads of Hydrostatics and Hydraulics)
belong also to a&euml;riform fluids.</p>

<p>The chemical properties of both liquids and fluids belong
peculiarly to the science of Chemistry, and are, therefore, not
to any extent, considered in this volume.</p>

<p>The air which we breathe is an elastic fluid, surrounding the
earth, and extending to an indefinite distance above its surface,
and constantly decreasing upwards in density. It has already
been stated that the air near the surface of the earth bears
the weight of that which is above it.</p>

<p>Being compressed, therefore, by the weight of that above
it, it must exist in a condensed form near the surface of the
earth, while in the upper regions of the atmosphere, where
there is no pressure, it is highly rarefied. This condensation,
or pressure, is very similar to that of water at great depths in
the sea.</p>

<p>Besides the two principal properties, gravity and elasticity,
the operations of which produce most of the phenomena of
Pneumatics, it will be recollected that as air, although an invisible
is yet a material substance, possessing all the common
properties of matter, it possesses also the common property of
<em>impenetrability</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Thermometer is an instrument to indicate the temperature
of the atmosphere.</em> It is constructed on the principle that
heat expands and cold contracts most substances. The
thermometer consists of a capillary tube, closed at the top and
terminating downwards in a bulb. It is filled with mercury
which expands and fills the whole length of the tube or contracts
altogether into the bulb, according to the degree of heat
or cold to which it is exposed. Any other fluid which is expanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
by heat and contracted by cold, may be used instead
of mercury.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The terms “rarefaction” and “condensation,” and “rarefied”
and “condensed,” must be clearly understood in this connection. They
are applied respectively to the expansion and compression of a body.</p></div>

<p>As it has been proved by experiment that 100 cubic inches
of air weighs 30<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> grains, it will readily be conceived that <em>the
whole atmosphere exercises a considerable pressure on the
surface of the earth</em>. The existence of this pressure is shown
by the following experiments. On one end of a stout glass
cylinder, about 10 inches high, and open at both ends, a piece
of bladder is tied quite air-tight. The other end, the edge of
which is ground and well-greased, is pressed on the plate of the
air-pump, Fig. <a href="#fig_331">331</a>. As soon as the air in the vessel is rarefied
by working the air-pump, the bladder is depressed by the
weight of the atmosphere above it, and finally bursts with a
loud report caused by the sudden entrance of air.</p>

<p>The preceding experiment only serves to illustrate the
downward pressure of the atmosphere. By means of the
<em>Magdeburg hemispheres</em>, Figs. <a href="#fig_332">332</a> and <a href="#fig_333">333</a>, the invention of
which is due to Otto von Guericke, burgomaster of Magdeburg,
it can be shown that the pressure acts in all directions.
This apparatus consists of two hollow brass hemispheres of 4<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches diameter, the edges of which are made to fit
tightly, and are well greased. One of the hemispheres is provided
with a stop-cock, by which it can be screwed on to the
air-pump, and on the other there is a handle. As long as the
hemispheres contain air they can be separated without any
difficulty, for the external pressure of the atmosphere is counterbalanced
by the elastic force of the air in the interior. But
when the air in the interior is pumped out by means of an
air-pump, the hemispheres cannot be separated without a
powerful effort.</p>

<p><em>The Barometer is an instrument to measure the weight of
the atmosphere</em>, and thereby to indicate the variations of the
weather, etc. It consists of a long
glass tube, about thirty-three
inches in length, closed at the upper
end, and filled with mercury.
The tube is then inverted in a
cup or leather bag of mercury, on
which the pressure of the atmosphere
is exerted. The following
experiment, which was first made
in 1643, by Torricelli, a pupil of
Galileo, gives an exact measure
of the weight of the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_334">
<img src="images/i_p020.jpg" width="250" height="504" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 334.</span></p></div>

<p>A glass tube is taken, about a
yard long and a quarter of an inch
internal diameter, Fig. <a href="#fig_334">334</a>. It is
sealed at one end, and is quite
filled with mercury. The aperture,
C, being closed by the thumb, the
tube is inverted, the open end
placed in a small mercury trough,
and the thumb removed. The
tube being in a vertical position,
the column of mercury sinks, and, after oscillating some time,
it finally comes to rest at a height, A, which at the level of the
sea is about 30 inches above the mercury in the trough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>The mercury is raised in the tube by pressure of the
atmosphere on the mercury in the trough. There is no contrary
pressure on the mercury in the tube, because it is
closed; but, if the end of the tube be opened, the atmosphere
will press equally inside and outside the tube, and the mercury
will sink to the level of that in the trough. It has been
shown that the heights of two columns of liquid in communication
with each other are inversely as their densities; and
hence it follows that the pressure of the atmosphere is equal
to that of a column of mercury the height of which is 30 inches.
If, however, the weight of the atmosphere diminishes, the
height of the column which it can sustain must also diminish.</p>

<p><em>Why a vacuum gauge is graduated in inches instead of in
pounds is thus explained.</em> Take a tube say 35 inches long,
closed at one end, filled with mercury and inverted with its
open end in a bowl containing the same liquid.</p>

<p>The atmosphere will exert on the surface of the mercury
in the bowl a pressure of about 15 pounds per square inch and
this pressure will be transmitted to that in the tube so that the
upward pressure inside the tube at the level of the mercury in
the bowl will be 15 pounds per square inch.</p>

<p>Below the surface the pressure increases, due to the depth
of mercury, but the weight of mercury inside the tube below
the level in the bowl counteracts the weight of that outside so
that the upward pressure per square inch at the surface line is
15 pounds per square inch inside the tube no matter how much
or little it is submerged. In the upper end of the tube the
mercury has dropped away, leaving a complete vacuum.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Moreover it has the advantage over a scientifically graduated
gauge, which would be graded at 0 for a perfect vacuum and 15, or more
nearly 14.7, for atmospheric pressure, that the inch indication increases as
the vacuum is more complete while the absolute pressure decreases. The
inch of mercury has also the advantage over the pound as a unit for measuring
the degree of vacuum or the difference between the pressure in the condenser
and that of the atmosphere that <em>there are twice as many inches in a
perfect vacuum as there are pounds</em> so that the gauge can be read more
closely without fractional units. It is easier to say 23 inches than eleven
and a half pounds.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>The 15 pounds will force the mercury up into the tube until
the column is high enough to balance that pressure. One
cubic inch of mercury weighs about half a pound. It would
take two cubic inches to weigh a pound and a column two
inches high to exert a pressure of one pound per square inch
of base, or a column 30 inches high to balance the pressure of
15 pounds.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_335">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 336.</span></p></div>

<p>If instead of a perfect vacuum there was a pressure of two
pounds in the upper end of the tube the column would have
to balance a pressure of 15-2 = 13 pounds and would be 26
inches high. As the absolute pressure in the top of the tube
gets greater, that is to say, as the difference between that pressure
and that of the atmosphere or the so-called vacuum gets
less, the column of mercury gets lower, and its height is a
measure of the completeness of the vacuum.</p>

<p><em>Hero’s fountain</em>, which derives its name from its inventor,
Hero, who lived at Alexandria, 120 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, depends on the
elasticity of the air. It consists of a brass dish, D, Fig. <a href="#fig_335">335</a>,
and of two glass globes, M and N. The dish communicates
with the lower part of the globe, N, by a long tube, B; and
another tube, A, connects the two globes. A third tube passes
through the dish, D, to the lower part of the globe, M. This
tube having been taken out, the globe, M, is partially filled with
water; the tube is then replaced and water is poured into the
dish. The water flows through the tube, B, into the lower globe,
and expels the air, which is forced into the upper globe; the
air, thus compressed, acts upon water, and makes it jet out as
represented in the figure. If it were not for the resistance of
the atmosphere and friction, the liquid would rise to a height
above the water in the dish equal to the difference of the level
in the two globes.</p>

<p><em>The fountain in vacuo</em>, Fig. <a href="#fig_336">336</a>, shows an interesting experiment
made with the air-pump, and shows the elastic force of
the air. It consists of a glass vessel, A, provided at the bottom
with a stop-cock, and a tubulure which projects into the interior.
Having screwed this apparatus on the air-pump, it is exhausted,
and the stop-cock being closed, it is placed in a vessel
of water, R. By opening the stop-cock, the atmospheric pressure
upon the water in the vessel makes it jet through the tubulure
into the interior of the vessel, as shown in the drawing.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—<em>Reference is hereafter very largely made to the mechanical use of
air as a moving power</em>, or rather as a means for transferring power, just as it
is transferred by a train of wheelwork. Compressed air can be employed in
this way with great advantage in mines, tunnels, and other confined situations,
where the discharge of steam would be attended with inconvenience.
The work is really done in these cases by a steam-engine or other prime
mover in compressing the air. In the construction of the Mont Cenis
tunnel the air was first compressed by water-power, and then carried through
pipes into the heart of the mountain to work the boring machines. This
use of compressed air in such situations is also of indirect advantage in
serving not only to ventilate the place in which it is worked, but also to cool
it; for it must be remembered that air falls in temperature during expansion,
and therefore, as its temperature in the machines was only that of the
atmosphere, it must, on being discharged from them, fall far below that
temperature. This fall is so great that one of the most serious practical
difficulties in working machines by compressed air has been found to be the
formation of ice in the pipes by the freezing of the moisture in the air, which
frequently chokes them entirely up.</p></div>

<h3>ON GASES.</h3></div>

<p>Gases are bodies which, unlike solids, have no independent
shape, and, unlike liquids, have no independent volume. Their
molecules possess almost perfect mobility; they are conceived
as darting about in all directions, and are continually tending
to occupy a greater space. This property of gases is known
by the names <em>expansibility</em>, <em>tension</em>, or <em>elastic force</em>, from which
they are often called <em>elastic fluids</em>.</p>

<p>Gases and liquids have several properties in common, and
some in which they seem to differ are in reality only different
degrees of the same property. Thus, in both, the particles
are capable of moving; in gases
with almost perfect freedom; in
liquids not quite so freely, owing
to a greater degree of viscosity.
Both are compressible, though in
very different degrees.</p>

<p>If a liquid and a gas both exist
under the pressure of one atmosphere,
and then the pressure
be doubled, the water is compressed
by about the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>20000</sub> part
while the gas is compressed by
one-half. In density there is a
great difference; water, which is
the type of liquids, is 770 times
as heavy as air, the type of gaseous bodies, while under the
pressure of one atmosphere. A spiral spring only shows
elasticity when it is compressed; it loses its tension when it
has returned to its primitive condition. A gas has no original
volume; it is always elastic, or in other words, it is always
striving to attain a greater volume; this tendency to indefinite
expansion is the chief property by which gases are distinguished
from liquids.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_337">
<img src="images/i_p024.jpg" width="250" height="347" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 337.</span></p></div>

<p>Matter assumes the solid, liquid, or gaseous form according
to the relative strength of the cohesive and repulsive forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
exerted between their molecules. In liquids these forces
balance; in gases repulsion preponderates.</p>

<p>By the aid of pressure and of low temperatures, the force of
cohesion may be so far increased in many gases that they are
readily converted into liquids, and we know now that with
sufficient pressure and cold they may all be
liquified. On the other hand, heat, which
increases the <em>vis viva</em> of the molecules,
converts liquids, such as water, alcohol and
ether or gas into the a&euml;riform state in
which they obey all the laws of gases. The
a&euml;riform state of liquids is known by the
name of <em>vapor</em>, while gases are bodies
which, under ordinary temperature and
pressure, remain in the a&euml;riform state.</p>

<p>In describing exclusively the properties
of gases, we shall, for obvious reasons, refer
to atmospheric air as their type.</p>

<p><em>Expansibility of Gases.</em> This property
of gases, their tendency to assume continually
a greater volume, is exhibited by
means of the following experiment:—A
bladder, closed by a stop-cock and about
half full of air, is placed under the receiver
of the air pump, Fig. <a href="#fig_337">337</a>, and a vacuum
is produced, on which the bladder immediately
distends.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_338">
<img src="images/i_p025.jpg" width="200" height="519" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 338.</span></p></div>

<p>This arises from the fact that the molecules of air flying
about in all directions press against the sides of the bladder.
Under ordinary conditions, this internal pressure is counterbalanced
by the air in the receiver, which exerts an equal and
contrary pressure. But when this pressure is removed, by exhausting
the receiver, the internal pressure becomes evident.
When air is admitted into the receiver, the bladder resumes
its original form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p><em>The compressibility of gases</em> is readily shown by the <em>pneumatic
syringe</em>, Fig. <a href="#fig_338">338</a>. This consists of a stout glass tube
closed at one end, and provided with a tight-fitting packed
piston. When the rod of the piston is pressed down in the
cube, the air becomes compressed into a smaller volume; but
as soon as the force is removed the air regains its original
volume, and the piston rises to its former position.</p>

<p><em>Weight of Gases.</em> From their extreme fluidity and expansibility,
gases seem to be uninfluenced by the force of
gravity: they nevertheless possess weight like solids and liquids.
To show this, a glass globe of 3 or 4 quarts’ capacity is taken,
Fig. <a href="#fig_339">339</a>, the neck of which is provided with a stop-cock, which
hermetically closes it, and by which it can be
screwed on the plate of the air-pump.</p>

<p>The globe is then exhausted, and its weight
determined by means of a delicate balance. Air
is now allowed to enter, and the globe again
weighed. The weight in the second case will be
found to be greater than before, and if the capacity
of the vessel is known the increase will obviously
be the weight of that volume of air.</p>

<p>When the atoms or particles which constitute
a body are so balanced by a system of attractions
and repulsions that they resist any force which
tends to change the figure of the body, they will
possess a property, known by the name of elasticity. <em>Elasticity,
therefore, is the property which causes a body to resume its shape
after it has been compressed or expanded.</em></p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_339">
<img src="images/i_p026.jpg" width="150" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 339.</span></p></div>

<p><em>Pressure exerted by Gases.</em> Gases exert on their own molecules,
and on the sides of vessels which contain them, pressures
which may be regarded from two points of view. First, we
may neglect the weight of the gas; secondly, we may take
account of its weight. If we neglect the weight of any gaseous
mass at rest, and only consider its expansive force, it will be
seen that the pressures due to this force act with the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
strength on all points, both of the mass itself and of the vessel
in which it is contained.</p>

<p>It is a necessary consequence of the elasticity and fluidity
of gases that <em>the repulsive force between the molecules is the
same at all points, and acts equally in all directions</em>.</p>

<p>If we consider the weight of any gas, we shall see that it
gives rise to pressures which obey the same laws as those produced
by the weight of liquids. Let us imagine a cylinder,
with its axis vertical, several miles high, closed at both ends
and full of air. Let us consider any small portion of the air
enclosed between two horizontal planes. This portion must
sustain the weight of all the air above it, and transmit that
weight to the air beneath it, and likewise to the curved surface
of the cylinder which contains it, and at each point in a direction
at right angles to the surface. Thus the pressure increases
from the top of the column to the base; at any given layer it
acts equally on equal surfaces, and at right angles to them,
whether they are horizontal, vertical, or inclined.</p>

<p>The pressure acts on the sides of the vessel, and it is
equal to the weight of a column of gas whose base is this
surface, and whose height its distance from the summit of the
column. <em>The pressure is also independent of the shape and
dimensions of the supposed cylinder</em>, provided the height remain
the same.</p>

<p>For a small quantity of gas the pressures due to its weight
are quite insignificant, and may be neglected; but for large
quantities, like the atmosphere, the pressures are considerable,
and must be allowed for.</p>

<p><em>Diffusion of gases.</em>—Liquids mixed together, gradually separate,
and lie superimposed in the order of their densities, and
the surfaces of the separation of the liquids are horizontal. But
when gases are mixed, they present other conditions of equilibrium,
as follows.</p>

<p>1.—A homogeneous and persistent mixture is formed rapidly,
so that all parts of the same volume are composed of the
same proportions of the mixed gases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>2.—In a mixture of gases, the pressure (or elastic force),
exercised by each of the gases, is the same as it was when
alone.</p>

<p>3.—The rapidity with which the diffusion takes place, varies
with the specific gravity of the gases. The more widely two
gases differ in density, the quicker the process of intermixture.</p>

<p><em>Evaporation.</em>—This is the slow formation of vapor from
the surface of a liquid. The elastic force of a vapor which
saturates a space containing a gas (like air), is the same as in a
vacuum. The principal causes which influence the amount and
rapidity of evaporation are as follows.</p>

<p>1st.—<em>Extent of a surface.</em> As the evaporation takes place
from the surface, an increase of surface evidently facilitates
evaporation.</p>

<p>2d.—<em>Temperature.</em> Increasing the elastic force of vapor,
has a most important influence on the rapidity of evaporation;
therefore the temperature of ebullition marks the maximum
point of evaporation.</p>

<p>3d.—<em>The quantity of the same liquid already in the atmosphere</em>
exercises an important influence on evaporation. The
atmosphere can absorb only a certain amount of vapor, and
evaporation ceases entirely when the air is saturated, but it
is greatest when free from vapor, that is perfectly dry.</p>

<p>4th.—<em>Renewal of the air.</em> If currents of air are continually
removing the saturated atmosphere from above the surface of
a liquid, evaporation takes place most rapidly, since new portions
of air, capable of absorbing moisture, are presented to it.
Evaporation is therefore more rapid in a breeze than in still air.</p>

<p>5th.—<em>Pressure on the surface of the liquid influences evaporation</em>,
because of the resistance thus offered to the escape of the
vapor. That is to say—water boils more freely in an open
vessel than within a steam boiler under pressure. Hence, the
necessity for having large steam disengaging surfaces to prevent
priming or lifting of the water when the boiler is forced beyond
its rated capacity.</p>

<h3>HAND AIR PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p>The use of compressed air has become very general through
the use of small hand pumps; the cylinder of these must be
smooth, and the plunger is usually packed with a cup leather
packing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_340">

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_340">340</a> shows a <em>gas fitter’s air proving pump</em>. The gauge
is attached to any opening into the system of pipes to be tested,
with a rubber hose leading to the pump. By working the
pump the air is forced into the pipes; upon stopping the pump
if the hand upon the gauge remains stationary there are no
leaks in the system. If there are leaks the hand of the gauge
will gradually return to the zero mark.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Before putting the pressure on it is customary to put some ether
into the small cup—near the gauge as shown—this has a cock which must
be opened and closed at the proper time so that the ether will be forced into
the pipe system and disclose by the sense of smell the location of the leak.</p></div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_341">341</a> shows a <em>Portable Tire Air Pump</em>, which can be used
by hand or affixed to a wall or bench; it is of the lever type, with
2 &times; 8 cylinders, fitted with check valve and extra heavy rubber
tubing. As the leverage on the piston-rod increases the resistance
on the piston also increases, thereby securing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
powerful leverage of the well-known “toggle-joint” principle
as the piston finishes its stroke; thus the best possible results
are obtained.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_342">342</a> illustrates a <em>Hand Lever Air Pump</em> with cylinder
3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>″ &times; 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>″; its capacity—one stroke—is 36 cubic inches. The
greatest pressure it is intended to operate against is 150 lbs.
to the square inch. In operation this design has the advantage
of the leverage of the toggle-joint
indicated above.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_343">343</a> exhibits a Hand Air Pump which has
the same dimensions as that just described, screwed to the floor.
Its particular advantage is the fact that the motion of the lever is
natural and easy being horizontal and still retaining the advantages of
the toggle-joint.</p>

<h3 id="AIR_AND_VACUUM_PUMPS">AIR AND VACUUM PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p><em>An air pump</em> is an apparatus for, 1, the exhaustion; 2,
compression or transmission of air.</p>

<p><em>A vacuum pump</em> is an apparatus consisting of, 1, a chamber
or barrel; 2, a suction pipe with a valve to prevent return flow;
3, a discharge pipe which has a valve which is closed when the
chamber is emptied and, 4, a steam induction pipe provided
with a valve that is opened when the chamber is filled with
water and closed when the chamber is filled with steam.</p>

<p>It is not right to call an air pump a vacuum pump, <em>as the
latter does not move</em> air alone; it removes water, vapor and air
from the condenser to form a vacuum. An air pump is designed
to pump air alone.</p>

<p><em>A vacuum is a space entirely devoid of matter.</em> That is, it
is a space that contains nothing—no oxygen, no hydrogen, no
air, no water, no pressure. It is for this reason that a perfect
vacuum in practice is very difficult to obtain, especially as
applied in a steam engine, as a liquid when in the presence of
a vacuum generally gives off some vapor, owing to the fact
that the surface is more or less in tension, besides its usual
evaporative quality. Among all the liquids it has been found
that mercury, on account of its very high specific gravity, can
be best used to produce a vacuum and maintain it, and it is
for this reason that the words “vacuum” and “inches of mercury”
are synonymous.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The pressure of the atmosphere will also balance a column of
water in a vacuum the same as a column of mercury but the height of the
water column must necessarily be greater on account of the lesser weight of
the water. A cubic inch of water weighs 13.6 times less than a cubic inch
of mercury, so that the column of water which the atmosphere must balance
must be 13.6 higher or 13.6 &times; 30 = 408 inches which is equivalent to 34 feet.</p>

<p><em>A water barometer</em> can be made in a similar manner to a mercury barometer
except that instead of a tube slightly over 30 inches in length, a tube
over 34 feet in height must be used. Advantage of this fact is taken in the
so-called gravity condensers which require no air pump, the condensing apparatus
being placed about 34 feet above the level of the hot well, the discharge
pipe being sealed by always keeping its lower end below the level of
the water in the hot well.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>The particular feature that makes steam valuable in producing
a vacuum is the fact that when it is condensed, it decreases
1600 times in volume and except for this small quantity
of water and some vapor which even cool water gives off in a
vacuum, a perfect vacuum would be established and it is only
necessary to draw off the condensed steam and vapor by proper
apparatus to enable the vacuum to be maintained which the
condensation has created. The apparatus for doing this is
called the air pump <em>and the reservoir in which this condensation
takes place is called the condenser</em>.</p>

<p>The condensation of steam in the condenser is effected in
two ways. The exhaust steam either meets in direct contact
the water which is to condense it, or, the steam impinges upon
cool metallic surfaces the temperature of which is kept down by
circulating cool water through them. In the first case the condensed
steam and the condensing water meet and mingle. The
condenser is an iron pot or shell into which the steam is exhausted
and the cooling water enters it in the form of a sheet
or spray. Such condensers are called <em>jet condensers</em> for this
reason, and the cooling water is called <em>the injection</em>. All water
that is used for condensing steam is therefore called <em>the injection
water</em>.</p>

<p>When the exhaust steam strikes cool surfaces and is condensed
by those surfaces, such condenser is called <em>a surface condenser</em>.
The cooling surface is usually a series of pipes or
tubes made of brass or copper to secure a rapid transfer of
heat. These tubes are usually tinned inside and outside to
prevent corrosion and in marine practice are made <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>″ in
diameter. In most cases, condensation is effected by bringing
the exhaust steam in contact with the outside of the tubes, the
circulating water being inside.</p>

<p><em>In the surface condenser</em>, as the circulation does not mingle
with the condensed steam, the air pump has nothing to do
with this water but is only required to pump out the condensed
steam and air which enter the condenser; the pump
which takes care of the circulation is called <em>the circulating pump</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
When large quantities of water are used and the difference in
level through which the water must be raised is slight as on
board ship, <em>centrifugal pumps</em> are generally used.</p>

<p><em>In the jet type of condenser</em> where the water acts directly
on the steam, the injection water will cause a lower temperature
with less water and less apparatus than a surface condenser.
The amount of injection water varies from 20 to 30 times the
weight of steam to be condensed in cool seasons and from 30
to 35 times the amount in summer season. With fresh water
this can be pumped into the boiler when the oil is extracted
from it. It is for this reason that surface condensers are universally
used for sea-going vessels to avoid salt water. They
are also much used on land in places where the feed water contains
mineral salts and is injurious to the boiler.</p>

<p>In places where the cost of hydrant water is excessive,
it is of importance to use the same injection water over and
over again, but this cannot be done until the water is first
cooled. There are numerous methods by means of which this
is done. All of these methods utilize the principle of scattering
the injection water in the way best calculated to bring the
greatest surface in contact with the largest quantity of air so
that evaporation may take place quickly and effectively.</p>

<p>This is sometimes done by pumping the water through a
number of spray nozzles up into the air, allowing it to fall into
a lake or cold well below, or, as is more usually the case, the injection
water is allowed to descend in a tower in a fine state
of division over tiles or wire gauze or corrugated surfaces.
A current of air, either forced by a fan or drawn up through
it, causes a vaporization of the film of warm water pouring over
the different surfaces, and the air cooling and the evaporation
combined withdraw the heat from the water so that when it
reaches the bottom it is in condition to be used again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_344">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 345.</span></p></div>

<p>Cooling towers are used with either jet or surface condensers
and can be used either with or without a fan, depending
upon the design. In general these towers usually lower the
temperature of the water from 120 degrees to 80 degrees, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
is sufficient to maintain a vacuum of about 26 inches. As they
depend chiefly upon the results of evaporation to do the cooling,
they work better on a dry day than when the air is humid.</p>

<p>The figures on the opposite page are designed to illustrate
the use of <em>an air pump in connection with a jet condenser</em>; this
combination is properly called a vacuum pump because it not
only pumps air, but water and vapor as well. The <em>steam end</em>
of this apparatus is described in Part One, page 324, of this
work.</p>

<p><em>The air and vacuum end</em> has a cylinder lined with composition-brass
bored smooth; the piston has square rubber and
canvas packing. The discharge—as shown in cut—is located
sufficiently high, so that the cylinder retains a large portion of
water. This forms a seal and causes the pump to work more
advantageously than it would with air alone. A small pipe
leads from the discharge chamber to the piston-rod stuffing-box.
This contains a double packing and the water which
flows through this small pipe forms a continuous seal around
the piston-rod and thus prevents air from entering.</p>

<p>The injection water enters the elbow at the top and is
drawn through an annular opening into the condenser. This
opening may be regulated by the small hand wheel shown at
the top end of the stem.</p>

<p>The exhaust from the steam end flows into the condenser
through the pipe as may readily be observed—or escapes into
the atmosphere by throwing the switch valve.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—<em>Utilizing hot discharge water.</em> In manufacturing establishments
where large quantities of water are required, advantage can be taken of the
fact that in condensing apparatus of this and similar pumps, the water, after
performing useful work in the condensing chamber, can be elevated to a
tank in any portion of the building, <em>and used over again for another purpose</em>,
such as washing, cooling metal plates, rolling-mill rolls, etc. The fact that
the temperature of this discharge water will range from 100&deg; to 120&deg; will, in
many cases, be advantageous, and effect a saving in the cost of heating other
water for purposes in which this discharge water will answer equally well.
<em>When the water is not required in the tank, the stop-valve may be opened,
and the water allowed to escape into a drain, or any other convenient place.</em></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>A ball-float attached to an air valve is located at the right
hand of the condenser so that in case the pump should fail to
operate from any cause, the injection water will lift the ball-float,
which in turn will open the air valve and by discharging
the vacuum will prevent the flooding of the engine cylinder
with water.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the atmosphere exerts what is
usually termed “back pressure” of 14.7 pounds per square inch
upon the piston area of a steam engine, also that water
converted into steam, may be converted into its original state
by condensation. Now, if this back pressure, which is, in reality,
the weight of the surrounding atmosphere, be removed from
the piston of a steam engine, the steam on the opposite side of
the piston would have that much (14.7 lbs.) less work to do.</p>

<p>Applying this to steam engines means conveying the exhaust,
or expanded steam, which would otherwise be allowed to escape
into the open air, into a closed chamber, where it is met
by a spray of cold water, which so rapidly absorbs the heat
contained in the steam that it ceases to retain its gaseous form,
and is again reduced to its original bulk as water. A great
change has now taken place, and the steam is reduced to its
liquid form. As this water of condensation only occupies
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1600</sub> of the space filled by the steam from which it was
formed, the remainder of the space is vacant, and no pressure
exists.</p>

<p>The difference in volume accounts for the atmospheric
pressure on the outside of the chamber, and as the vacuum extends
throughout the whole distance which the exhaust steam
originally occupied, it, of course, is made available in the
cylinder of the engine in the shape of a decreased pressure on
the exhaust side of the piston; the atmospheric pressure remains
constant, therefore we have the atmospheric pressure
acting on one side of the piston, and absent on the other; the
gain being 14.7 pounds per square inch, if a perfect vacuum
could be secured. It amounts in average engineering practice
to from 12 to 13 pounds, or 24 to 26 inches of mercury, as the
graduations usually read on vacuum gauges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>Jet and Surface Condensers are further described and illustrated
in a special allotted section of this work. The vacuum
pump is usually of the reciprocating order, although other
methods have been employed for emptying condensers, but not
with equally satisfactory results.</p>

<p><em>The gain to be secured by using a condensing apparatus</em>
may be measured in two ways: first, by the decrease in
fuel consumption over that necessary when running non-condensing,
which will represent a constant decrease in running
expenses; or, second, by the increase of power working quite
up to its economical limit, in a non-condensing engine.</p>

<p>By the use of a condenser a further increase of power is realized
in raising the mean effective pressure of steam within the
engine cylinder without increasing the demand upon the boiler.</p>

<p><em>The application of a condenser to a steam engine</em> increases
its economy from 20% to 25% depending upon circumstances,
while by compounding and condensing an economy of 35% to
40% is effected.</p>

<p>These pipes are simple in design and run direct to the boiler for
live steam and convey the exhaust to the atmosphere or condenser as
desired.
On a recent test at a fair rate of speed the capacity of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>

engine of 2,000 I. H. P. On a further test this same
pump on a basis of 20 lbs. weight of steam per I. H. P. per
hour demonstrated its ability
to take care of 3,000 I. H. P.
triple expansion engine.</p>

<p>The advantages claimed
for this pump are briefly as
follows:</p>

<p>Unusual light weight and
compactness.</p>

<p>There being <span class="smcap lowercase">NO SUCTION
VALVES</span>, working-beams, rock
shaft and bearings, beam-links,
etc., this pump is simple.</p>

<p>It is economical in the
use of steam, by reason of
compounding the steam cylinders;
also clearance loss is
reduced to a minimum by the
perfect regulation that is secured
by the valve gear described.
Full stroke at any
and all speeds can be readily
maintained.</p>

<p>As the air pistons travel
within a distance of less than
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch of the air cylinder
heads, a high efficiency results.
Although double-acting,
the flow of water and
vapors is always in one continuous
direction—the same
as in a single-acting air pump. Either side of pump can run
independent of the other, which means a spare pump to be
used in case of accident to the other side of this pump.</p>

<p>Referring to the accompanying table of tests, page 41, it
may be claimed that with an average of 36 double strokes per
minute this pump handled at the rate of upwards of 26,000
pounds of feed-water per hour, which on a basis of 20 lbs.
engine economy shows this vacuum pump capable of taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
care of a 1,300 I. H. P. engine at this very moderate speed.
By comparing the power required to drive this pump (which
aggregated 1.18 I. H. P.) to the I. H. P. of an engine of the
power here represented it is apparent that this pump did its
work on less than one-eleventh of one per cent. of the I. H. P.
of said engine, which is a very excellent showing.</p>

<p><em>The Deane Vacuum Pump.</em> There are a number of novel
features exhibited in the construction of this pump; the cylinder
has four ports, that is to say <em>two steam or admission ports
and two compression or cushioning ports</em>.</p>

<p>Referring to the engraving, page 42, Fig. <a href="#fig_350">6</a>, shows the main
valve to be a plain <span class="sans"><b>D</b></span> slide,—directly under it the same valve is
shown in section. The projection on the back of this valve
fits into the valve piston. The secondary valve, 5, surrounds
the main valve and contains two plain slide valves, one on each
side. Referring to 3, it will be noted that one of these valves
admits steam while the other allows the steam to escape after
having done its work of moving the valve piston.</p>

<p>A longitudinal section of this secondary valve and steam
cylinder are shown, in 2.</p>

<p>In the engraving, 1, it is shown that the cylinder for each
end of the valve piston is jacketed with live steam so that the
cylinder itself heats up as quickly as the valve piston, hence
the piston cannot stick in the cylinder due to unequal expansion
of valve and seat.</p>

<p>The supplemental valve ports are shown in section 4.</p>

<p><em>To set the valve of this pump</em>: Remove the steam chest,
place the piston at mid stroke with the lever, plumb, then set
the stem at its mid position with the secondary valve in place.
See that the tappets measure equal distances either side of the
tappet block.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—These small ports are not liable to fill with oil and dirt in practice,
on account of their direct connections. If through leakage or any
other reason the valve piston should fail to throw the main slide valve, the
projection B (see 1) on the valve stem (of which it is a part) compels the
valves to move mechanically. So when steam is turned on, this pump is
certain to begin its work.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_351">
<img src="images/i_p044.jpg" width="351" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 351.</span></p></div>

<p>The water end of this pump consists of a cylinder with valve
chambers as shown. The piston rod has two stuffing-boxes,
which makes a water seal around the rod so that no air can
enter the cylinder, as the chamber between the two stuffing-boxes
is kept constantly filled with water. It will be noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
that the suction pipe enters the pump in such a position in relation
to the valves that both suction and discharge valves are
perpetually immersed in water.</p>

<p>When this pump is pumping air only, there is sufficient
water left within the valve chambers to provide a water seal
under all working conditions. The valves in this pump are
easily reached for inspection or repairs, a hand-hole being provided
for each valve, with proper covers, which are easily and
quickly replaced.</p>

<p><em>The Worthington Vertical Beam Vacuum Pump</em> with condenser
attached is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_351">351</a>.</p>

<p>This is a pump of great simplicity and strength. The figure
shows <em>a compound engine</em> for using high pressure steam; these
machines can be built with simple steam cylinders of equal diameters,
but they are not recommended except in special cases;
for example where the steam pressure is very low. Each side
of the pump end is single-acting, the buckets being of the form
used for years in detached air pumps in marine service. The
two sides are connected together by a beam and links attached
to the cross-heads. As one side comes down and does little
work, the other side makes an up-stroke and does full duty in
emptying the condenser to which the suction is attached.</p>

<p>The condensing chamber is usually placed at the rear and
connects directly with the channel plate at the bottom of the
pump. The opening shown in front is for the discharge water.</p>

<p>The steam cylinders are so arranged that either piston may
be examined by removing its cylinder head, without disturbing
the other cylinders. The valves are of the Corliss, or semi-rotative,
type and the high-pressure cylinders are provided with
cut-off valves to assure the desired ratio of expansion.</p>

<p>The interior of each air cylinder may be inspected by removing
the plates shown in front, near the middle. There are
also two plates at the top for inspection of the discharge valves.
The four machinery steel columns form a light but very strong
frame allowing free access to the working parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>The next four cuts show Dean Brothers’ twin cylinder air
pumps with their special steam valve gear. They are made for
and supplied with either surface or jet condensers. See Fig. <a href="#fig_352">352</a>.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the valve gear is such that steam will
be applied at the upper end of one piston at the same instant
that it begins to act on the lower end of the other. By this
device steam is so controlled in the steam chests that no pressure
comes on the main pistons, until the moment that both are
ready to move, after having reached the full limit of their
stroke, thereby securing an exactly uniform, but opposite, motion
of the pistons. Fig. <a href="#fig_354">354</a> is a sectional elevation of the
steam cylinder and steam chest; Fig. <a href="#fig_353">353</a>, a front elevation;
Fig. <a href="#fig_355">355</a>, a section of the air cylinder, and Fig. <a href="#fig_352">352</a>, an exterior
perspective view of the pump.</p>

<p>Each steam cylinder has its own steam piston, piston rod,
valve movement, steam chest, etc. A sleeve, <em>a</em>, is rigidly attached
to each piston rod, and connected to this sleeve is a
lever, <em>b</em>, the outer end of which connects with a link, <em>c</em>, which
in turn is connected to a sleeve, <em>d</em>, loosely mounted upon the
valve rod between collars, <em>e</em>. The valve rod, <em>f</em>, operates the
auxiliary slide valve and admits the steam from above and
below the auxiliary piston. This piston has attached thereto
the main slide valve, which admits and exhausts steam alternately
from above and below the main steam pistons. Any
movement of the main piston communicates movement in the
opposite direction to the sleeve, <em>d</em>, which moves the valve rod
only when it strikes one or the other of the collars. As there
is considerable lost motion between the sleeve and the collars,
the main steam piston will be nearing the end of its stroke
when the valve rod begins to move.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_353">
<img src="images/i_p048.jpg" width="483" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 353.</span></p></div>

<p>Extending through the ends of the steam chests are short
piston rods, <em>g</em>, which are connected to a centrally pivoted
vibrating lever, <em>h</em>, mounted on a pivot. When the main steam
piston has moved from the top to the bottom of the steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
cylinder, the corresponding valve rod has moved in the opposite
direction and the auxiliary slide valve has moved upward,
opening the port, <em>i</em>, to steam and the port, <em>k</em>, to the exhaust
port. At the moment the main steam piston has completed
its downward stroke the auxiliary piston is forced upward and
carries with it the main slide valve, <em>l</em>. This opens the main
steam port and exhaust port, which reverses the movement of
the main piston. When the main piston reaches the upward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
limit of its stroke the auxiliary
valve has moved downward,
opening the port, <em>k</em>, to steam
and the port, <em>i</em>, to the exhaust,
causing the auxiliary piston to
move downward, thus reversing
the movement of the main valve
and piston.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_354">
<img src="images/i_p049_fig_354.jpg" width="231" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 354.</span></p></div>

<p>By this arrangement the
valve operating piston, <em>m</em>, is
held at all times immovably at
one end of the stroke, except
when the main piston is nearing
the end of its stroke and is ready
to reverse. Supposing the left-hand
main piston has not quite
reached the upper limit of the
stroke, the steam would still be
on the lower side of its auxiliary
or main valve operating piston
and the exhaust open to the
other side. We now have steam
on the bottom side of both
auxiliary pistons, and as they
are of equal diameters and
are connected by the lever, <em>h</em>,
they are balanced and cannot
move the main steam valves.
The right-hand main steam
piston must wait until the left-hand
piston has completed its
stroke before it can reverse, and
consequently the movement of
the main pistons will always be
in opposite directions, and
neither can reverse until both
have completed their stroke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>There are three ways that this apparatus may be operated:
First, the pumps may be operated in conjunction with each
other, as is hereinbefore described. Second, the lever, <em>h</em>, may
be detached from the auxiliary or main valve operating pistons,
and the two pumps may then run independently of each
other or in the ordinary and well-known manner, each performing
its own independent work. Third, by further detaching
the link, <em>c</em>, on one of the valve gears the auxiliary slide valve,
<em>n</em>, will remain at rest and the corresponding pump will not
move while the other pump continues to operate. These are
important features, because, as in case of accident, it may be
necessary to use one pump while the other is disabled, and in
some cases it may be desirable to operate the pumps independently.
The engineer will appreciate this feature, as the stoppage
of an air pump is a serious matter.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_355">
<img src="images/i_p049_fig_355.jpg" width="250" height="318" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 355.</span></p></div>

<p>The piston rods are separable at the crossheads. The crossheads
are of steel. The steam cylinders and pump cylinders
are connected by six heavy steel stretcher rods. Adjusting
valves are fitted to steam cylinders for controlling motion of
pistons. The valve gear is provided with a special lever adjustment
by which the length of stroke of pistons may at any
time be changed, even while the pump is running.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig_356">356</a> is shown a form of independent vacuum pump,
with its condenser, built by the Conover Mfg. Co.</p>

<p>This apparatus consists of a jet condenser with air pump, boiler feed
pump, and engine to drive both, combined as one machine. The air pump
is a single acting bucket plunger pump, driven by a crank shaft, turned
by the engine, which is a single cylinder compound automatic cut-off
engine, and also drives the boiler feed pump; it is of the trunk
pattern, and the small space around the trunk on the top side of the
piston forms the high pressure cylinder. Steam is admitted to the high
pressure side, at boiler pressure, and is cut off and expanded and
exhausted into the receiver, whence it is admitted under the bottom
side of the piston, where it is again cut off and expanded, finally
exhausting into the condenser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p><em>The piston makes the down stroke when the air pump makes
the up stroke</em>; and it will be seen by referring to the cut that
the engine does nearly all its work when making the downward
stroke. When steam is acting on the top side of piston at high
pressure, the vacuum at the same time is pulling on the full
area of the piston underneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_356">
<img src="images/i_p051.jpg" width="509" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 356.</span></p></div>

<p>When the engine makes the up stroke, the steam at low
pressure from the receiver acts to push the piston up; and as
the air pump is doing no work then, being on its down stroke,
the only work of the engine is to keep the machine up to speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_357">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 357.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the engine is suited to meet the demand
of the large power on one stroke, and very little on the
other, thus adapting itself admirably to its requirements.</p>

<p>The valves are of the Corliss type, and do not trip; the cut-off
being set by hand, does not require to be changed or
altered, as the speed is controlled by a throttling governor.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_357">357</a> shows a cross section through the steam cylinder
of this vacuum pump.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_358">
<img src="images/i_p053.jpg" width="450" height="552" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 358.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The Edwards air and vacuum pump</em> is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_358">358</a>,
<a href="#fig_359">359</a> and <a href="#fig_360">360</a>, in which it may be perceived that both foot and
bucket valves are dispensed with; the only valves used are those
which in other pumps are known as head or discharge valves.</p>

<p>The following brief description of its leading features will
be understood by reference to the illustrations: Fig. <a href="#fig_358">358</a> is a
sectional view through the center of the air pump, but the
piston and rod are shown as a full view.</p>

<p>The action of this pump is as follows: the condensed steam
flows continuously by gravity from the condenser into the base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
of the pump, and is there dealt with mechanically by the conical
bucket working in connection with a base of similar shape.
Upon the descent of the bucket the water is projected silently
and without shock at a high velocity through the ports into the working
barrel (see Fig. <a href="#fig_359">359</a>). The rising water is followed by the rising
bucket, which closes the ports, and, sweeping the air and water before
it, discharges them through the valve at the top

of the barrel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_359">
<img src="images/i_p054.jpg" width="366" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 359.</span></p></div>

<p>It may be said that however slowly an ordinary air pump with foot
and bucket valves may be running, the pressure in the condenser has
to be sufficiently above that in the pump to lift the foot valves,
overcome the inertia of the water, and drive the water up through the
valves into the barrel where the water is dealt with mechanically. The
higher the speed of the older type of pump the greater is the pressure
required to overcome these resistances owing to the very short space
of time available, and as any increase of pressure in the condenser is
accompanied by a corresponding increase of back pressure in the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> low
pressure cylinder, hence the absence of the valves referred to allows a
higher speed of the plunger. The elimination of the foot valves it is
claimed gives from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 1 inch better vacuum.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_360">
<img src="images/i_p055.jpg" width="350" height="377" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 360.</span></p></div>

<p>Another advantage claimed for this pump is that clear air inlets are
maintained—see Figs. <a href="#fig_359">359</a> and <a href="#fig_360">360</a>. Under ordinary working conditions,
when the bucket descends and the ports open, there is no obstruction
between the condenser and the pump; the air has a free entrance while
immediately afterward the water is injected into the barrel at a high
velocity. Thus, instead of obstructing the entrance of the air, the
water tends to compress that already in the barrel, and to entrain or
carry in more air with it.</p>

<p>The bucket or piston is a hollow casting with water grooves instead
of packing rings.</p>

<p>The valve seat is constructed with a rib between each valve and a
lip around the outer edge, so that each valve stands in its own water
and is separated from the others. This forms a ready means of testing
the relative tightness of each valve.</p>

<p>The cast iron working barrel is lined with brass.</p>

<p>The pump rod is Tobin bronze, and valve plate and valves of
composition. These pumps are either single, twin, triplex, and are
steam, electric or belt driven, for stationary, marine or sugar
plantation service.</p>

<p>The steam driven pumps are built with either single or compound
steam cylinders, fitted with new and improved valve gear, and with
their arrangement of fly-wheels, insures smooth running, making full
strokes free from vibration.</p>

<h3 id="AIR_COMPRESSORS">AIR COMPRESSORS.</h3></div>

<p><em>Compressed air</em> is air compressed by mechanical force into
a state of more or less increased density. <em>The power obtained
from the expansion</em> of greatly compressed air in a cylinder,
on being set free is used in many applications as a substitute
for steam or other force as in operating drills, shop tools and
<em>engines</em> which are driven by the elastic force of compressed air.</p>

<p><em>A compressor</em> is a machine usually driven by steam by which
air is compressed in a receiver so that its expansion may be
utilized as a source of power at distances where an ordinary
engine could not be conveniently used.</p>

<p>The compressor proper comprises two sets of valves, usually
designed to be opened automatically by excess of pressure
under them and to be closed by gravity or by the action of
springs when the pressures become equal. The inlet valves
open just after the piston commences its stroke, when the expansion
of the compressed air remaining in the cylinder behind
the piston has lowered the pressure above the valves. They
close at the end of the intake stroke, just as the piston comes
to rest. The outlet valve lifts during the compression stroke, at
about the time the rising pressure in the cylinder becomes equal
to that in the outlet passage above the valves; and they close
when the flow of air ceases as the piston completes its stroke.</p>

<p>Any of the accurately fitted steam engine valve gears may
be used for compressors, observing only that the compressor is
in every way a reversed steam engine.</p>

<p><em>The office of the air compressor is to store up air under high
pressures</em>, which can be utilized at a greater or less distance,
without sustaining any loss by condensation in the pipes, as
is the case of carrying steam in pipes long distances.</p>

<p>Air stored under pressure in a reservoir can be used expansively,
in an ordinary steam engine returning an equivalent
amount of work that was required to compress it—less the
friction.</p>

<p>The admission of the air being through a single tube, it
creates a constant flow of air in one direction only, thus filling
the cylinder at each stroke with air at atmospheric pressure.
This movement gives a momentum to the air which causes it
to fill the cylinder to its fullest extent at each stroke.</p>

<p><em>Air compressors may be driven in various ways</em>, but the most
commonly used are those which are directly connected to a
steam engine, thus doing away with intermediate machinery.
When the air piston draws in a charge of air, the air fills the
cylinder at atmospheric pressure, or a little below, and on the
return stroke of the piston it has to be compressed to the same
pressure as in the receiver before it can lift the delivery valve,
and as the valve is held to its seat by a spring, and also by its
own weight, the pressure has to be considerably above that of
the receiver before the valve will lift. To overcome this the
valves are operated by mechanical means, which lifts them
at a point of the stroke, when the pressure in the cylinder corresponds
with that of the receiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>This arrangement avoids pounding of the valves as well as
the noise caused by the air when rushing at much higher pressure
from the cylinder into the receiver.</p>

<p>For the sake of economy, air compressors are compounded,
as for example, by drawing the air into a large cylinder and
compressing it to a certain stage, whence it passes into a smaller
cylinder, which compresses it to a much higher pressure.</p>

<p>In a simple compressor, for very high pressures, there is at
the end of the stroke a large volume of air left in the clearance
space, which expands on the return stroke, to atmospheric
pressure, before another charge of air can be drawn in.</p>

<p>But in the compound compressor, the air is delivered from
the low pressure receiver to the high pressure cylinder far above
atmospheric pressure, thus the remaining air need not expand
so much and allows the cylinder to take a larger volume of air.
The load is also distributed more evenly.</p>

<p>The following are valuable “points” relating to the care
and management of air compressors.</p>

<p>As in a steam pipe line, elbows should be avoided in an
air pipe line but unlike a steam pipe it should be larger.</p>

<p>A mistake is sometimes made in purchasing a compressor
built for a low altitude and trying to run it in a higher elevation;
the machine then experiences the same trouble that some
people do, in not being able to get breath enough under the
changed conditions.</p>

<p>The use of cheap oils, especially in an air cylinder is a most
serious mistake, as the least tendency to gum will prevent the
valves from properly seating, and even with the best of oils, it
is well to use a small amount of mineral oil at times.</p>

<p>In localities where the water is bad, the water jacket will
require extra attention, as it gets as badly scaled like steam
boilers, principally due to a very slow or retarded circulation,
which allows the sediment to settle, and should the water
supply be shut off, even for a few minutes, the cylinder heat
will bake it so hard as to give considerable trouble. It
is a good plan to put a good boiler compound in the water
jacket, and run the machine for some time without any circulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_364">
<img src="images/i_p062.jpg" width="600" height="295" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 364.</span> (See page <a href="#Page_71">71</a>.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
In this case good judgment must be used not to run
too long or too fast, as the cylinder will heat very quickly and
is liable to be damaged.</p>

<p>There are many emergency ways of stopping small pipe
leaks; any good sticky substance, such as tar, wax, tallow
candles, or even chewing gum, melted and applied on narrow
strips of cloth and wound as a bandage, will be found handy.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that leaks in an air pipe line are as
bad as in a steam pipe line, and should receive as much care.</p>

<p><em>The theoretical operation of air compressors may be thus
explained</em>:</p>

<p>If a tight cylindrical vessel, containing one cubic foot of
air at atmospheric pressure, be fitted with a piston which is free
to move up and down but yet perfectly tight, the air in the
vessel will have no means of escape, and the pressure within
and without the vessel, both being atmospheric, are balanced.</p>

<p>Now, if the piston should be loaded with a weight, the pressure
on the outside would be that due to the atmosphere, plus
the weight, while the pressure from the inside is simply equal
to atmospheric pressure; thus the piston is forced to descend,
but as the air inside of the cylinder has no means of escape, the
volume it fills being diminished, its pressure rises until the
pressure under the piston balances that above it.</p>

<p>If, for example, the area of the piston should be 100 square
inches, and the weight with which it is loaded be 100 pounds,
assuming the piston to be without weight, the pressure below
will have to react with an equal force to hold the piston
stationary, which in this case would be 1 pound to the square
inch above atmospheric pressure, and the piston would have to
descend sufficiently to cause this increase of pressure, which
descent would be equal to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> of the total fall of the piston. By
adding another 100 pounds above, the pressure would rise to
2 pounds to the square inch. The cylinder is thus charged
with compressed air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<div class="bboxthin">

<p class="padl1 padr1"><em>Liquid Air</em> is a marvelous result of compression. It liquefies at a
pressure of 573 pounds per square inch, at the reduced temperature of
-220&deg; F.; at atmospheric pressure it boils at -312&deg; F., at which temperature
it can be handled like water. <em>Air</em> is the vapor of a liquid, and
acts in its properties like the vapor of other liquids. Liquid air in color
is like that of a blue sky on a cloudless day.</p></div>

<p class="padl1 padr1">“<em>Denys Papin</em> was the first to propose and make, in 1653, an actual
trial of the transmission of power to a distance by compressed air. It
was the fertile and mechanical brain of Papin that first conceived the
idea of the pneumatic tube for transmitting parcels by air pressure.”

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>If now the bottom of the cylinder should be connected by
means of a pipe to another vessel of larger capacity called a
receiver, the pipe having been closed by a valve in it during
compression, and the valve should be opened, the piston would
at once commence a further descent, the compressed air
escaping into the receiver, until the pressure in the receiver
and cylinder is equalized, or the piston reaches the bottom of
the cylinder, which it will do, if the receiver is large enough.
Then the valve closes, stopping communication between
cylinder and receiver, and the piston is drawn upward; at the
same time air is again admitted to the cylinder by another
valve, which closes when the piston reaches the top, and the
same operation is again repeated.</p>

<p>The receiver can thus be charged with compressed air and by
loading the piston very heavy the pressure can be raised quite high.</p>

<p>Now, if the piston, instead of being loaded by weights, be
connected to the piston rod of a steam engine, or by means of
a connecting rod to a crank (which is rotated by a belt or some
other driving mechanism, and the valves be operated automatically,
as the valves on a water pump), the simple apparatus
is converted into a perfect air compressor, <em>which really is
nothing else than an air pump</em>, and the air can be pumped into
the receiver against a high pressure the same as water is forced
into an elevated reservoir by a pump.</p>

<p>As air is a compressible gas, it acts a little different in the
air cylinder from the almost incompressible water in a pump.</p>

<p>To lift the valves of an air compressor by the compressed
air pressure in the cylinder (added to the pressure of their
springs besides the receiver pressure), the air would have to be
compressed considerably above the receiver pressure before it
would lift the valve which allows it to flow from the cylinder
into the receiver, and then the valve would not open freely as
a pump valve, but would chatter, causing a disagreeable noise,
and damaging the valve.</p>

<p><em>To avoid this, the valves of an air compressor are operated
by mechanical means.</em> Some devices operate the valve directly
as soon as the pressure in the cylinder reaches that of the receiver,
while others simply release it of the spring pressure, the
valve itself being lifted by the air itself. Such devices generally
give the valves a full free opening, without noise.</p>

<p><em>The blowing engine</em> is almost identical with the air compressor.
The chief difference between them being the ratio
of steam cylinder to air cylinder. While the air compressor
furnishes a comparatively small amount of air at very high
pressures, <em>the blowing engine delivers a very large volume at
lower pressures</em>.</p>

<p>Blowing engines are mainly used in large blast furnaces,
smelting works and foundries, to furnish the air pressure for
cupolas, air furnaces and smelting ovens.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig_366">366</a> is shown a blowing engine of very large size;
the steam cylinder is 42 inches in diameter, the air cylinder 84
inches, and the stroke 60 inches.</p>

<p><em>The valve gear is of the Reynolds-Corliss type.</em> The piston
rod is attached to a cross-head extending through the guides,
which are formed by the frame, with wrist pins upon each
end, from which the two connecting rods are suspended with
their lower ends connected to the cranks, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_366">366</a>.
There are two air piston rods attached to the main piston and
held to the cross-head by nuts at points near the guides.</p>

<p>The crank shaft carrying the flywheels, which also form the
cranks attached to the ends of this shaft, is located below the
steam cylinder. This construction is of the return connecting
rod engine design, to economize space.</p>

<p>Both the air and steam valve gears are worked from eccentrics
on an auxiliary shaft, driven from the main shaft by
bevel gears underneath the steam cylinder.</p>

<p><em>The “Imperial” air compressor</em> is presented herewith in
Figs. <a href="#fig_367">367</a> and <a href="#fig_368">368</a>.</p>

<p>The “Imperial” compressor is especially designed for use
in machine shops, foundries and other industrial establishments
where it is not convenient to use a steam driven compressor.</p>

<p>The machine has two vertical, single-acting cylinders, each
employing long trunk pistons that act as guides for the lower
ends of the connecting rods. By this design, the height of the
machine is reduced, stuffing-boxes and crossheads are eliminated,
and a minimum number of bearings required. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
cranks are set opposite to each other, so that when the piston
on one side is ascending, the other side is descending.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_367">
<img src="images/i_p068.jpg" width="471" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 367.</span></p></div>

<p>The machine is made with duplex cylinders for the low
pressures used in sand blast work and the like, and with either
duplex or compound cylinders for higher pressures. In the
compound type, an intercooler is supplied, through which the
air passes from the low pressure to the high pressure cylinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p><em>The air cylinders</em> are water-jacketed and provided with
hooded heads, so that air may be supplied to them from outside
the compressor-room; the cylinders are cast in one piece
with the frame.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_368">
<img src="images/i_p069.jpg" width="467" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 368.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The air-valves</em>, both inlet and outlet, are of the poppet
type, fitted with light springs, and work vertically. On account
of their position at the bottom of the cylinder, they are well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
lubricated, and, acting vertically, they have little tendency to
wear out of line with their seats.</p>

<p><em>The air intake passage</em> is tapped to receive a supply pipe
leading from out-of-doors, or from some place where cool and
clean air is obtainable. The compressed air is discharged into
a passage which is tapped for a pipe to convey it to the air-receiver.</p>

<p><em>All parts of the compressor are easily accessible</em> for inspection,
adjustment, or repair. The air-heads may be removed
without disturbing any of the pipe connections. The
valves may be taken out by unscrewing the bonnets.</p>

<p>All the latter, as may be seen by the engravings, have the
positive valve motion operated by an eccentric. In selecting
an air compressor the following points need consideration:
1, Number of cubic feet of free air required per minute; 2,
Altitude, <em>i.e.</em>, the number of feet above the sea level; 3, Steam
pressure and air pressure.</p>

<p><em>The use of compressed air for operating mining pumps</em>, while
having advantages in some cases, <em>is not to be recommended in
all</em>, particularly on account of the low efficiency of the plant as
a whole. The loss due to leaks is serious, and the long line of
piping with its numerous joints causes much trouble, delay and
expense.</p>

<p><em>In Fig. <a href="#fig_369">369</a> is shown a direct acting steam single air compressor</em>;
simplicity in its construction is a leading feature and
there are few parts in this pump that are liable to wear.</p>

<p>This apparatus is designed for working
pressures up to twenty pounds; it
is intended for use in oil refineries,
smelting works, blast furnaces and in
all situations where compressed air of
medium pressure is required. They
are variously used for sand blasts,
ventilating purposes, and for pneumatic
deliveries.</p>

<p>The steam end and valve motion
are the regular Deane pattern, assuring
positive operation. The air cylinder is
provided with a water jacket.</p>

<p><em>A power wall or post air compressor</em>
is shown in Figs. <a href="#figs_370_371">370</a>-<a href="#fig_372">372</a>. The machine
is single acting and is recommended
where little space is available, as it can be bolted to
the wall or to a post, or on the under side of the ceiling. The
crank shaft and connecting rod are of cast steel. The bearings
are babbitted and adjustable. The piston is of the trunk form,
carrying a pin for the connecting rod, and is of extra length to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
act as a guide for the lower end of the connecting rod. The
valves are of the poppet type. These compressors are extensively
used in electric power stations for supplying air for
removing dust from electric machinery, in bicycle shops for inflating
pneumatic tires, maintaining a supply of air in pressure
tanks, and for various purposes where a limited supply of air is
needed.</p>

<p>These compressors are of <em>the “Blake” design</em> and the following
particulars will be of interest.</p>

<p><em>With increase in altitude</em> the barometric or atmospheric

about 10 pounds at 10,000 feet above sea level. Since the

at such an altitude the total weight of air handled by a given

<p>The fact that the heating effect of compressing air from an
initial pressure of 10 pounds absolute to 90 pounds gauge pressure
is theoretically equivalent to that of compression to 132
pounds at sea level, <em>makes a two-stage arrangement more imperative
in high level work than under ordinary conditions</em>.</p>

<h3>COMPOUNDING OR TWO-STAGE COMPRESSION.</h3></div>

<p>The two-stage or multi-stage system of air compression is
used generally for high pressure work. The system is most
usefully employed between 40 and 120 pounds gauge pressure.
For the moderate working pressure of 90 to 100 lbs., the two-stage
compression has demonstrated its efficiency chiefly for
the reason, that the heat generated in the last half of the stroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of a single compressor is by the two-stage process greatly
reduced.</p>

<p>Further compounding, for pressures above 100 pounds, becomes
quite necessary to secure the advantages named hereafter;
the two-stage has proved advantageous up to 500 lbs.,
three-stage up to 1,000 lbs., and four-stage compression up to
3,000 lbs.</p>

<p>As the pressures increase, however, the machines become
more and more complicated, owing not only to the greater
power required, but also to the heating of the air during compression.
The use of water-jackets for cooling the air in the
compression cylinders is general, but this does not effect thorough
cooling, as only a small portion of the air in the cylinder
comes in contact with the jacketed parts. This difficulty has
led to the use of compound machines, in which case inter-coolers
are generally used between the different stages of compression,
which cause the air to shrink in volume between the
stages.</p>

<p>Briefly summed up, the chief advantages of multi-stage over
single-stage compression are:</p>

<p>1. <em>Lower average temperature</em>, resulting in lower average
pressure, and permitting the compression of the same volume
of air with less expenditure of energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>2. <em>Increased safety and ease of lubrication.</em> When high
final temperatures prevail, part of the lubricating oil vaporizes,
and wear on the piston and cylinder becomes rapid. Under
exceptional circumstances the combination of air and oil vapor
may reach the proportions of an explosive mixture, and if the
compression temperature passes its flash point damage may
result. Such accidents are, however, very rare even in single-stage
work; in multi-stage compression, with proper intercooling,
they are impossible.</p>

<p>3. <em>Greater effective capacity in free air.</em> The final pressure
in the low pressure cylinder is much lower than in a single-stage
machine, and the air confined in the clearance spaces when expanded
down to atmospheric pressure occupies comparatively
little space. Consequently the inflow of air through the suction
valves begins at an earlier point in the stroke.</p>

<p>4. <em>The air delivered by a two-stage or multi-stage compressor
is dryer than that furnished by a single cylinder.</em> Under constant
pressure the power of air to hold watery vapor decreases
with its temperature, and during its passage through the inter-cooler
much of the original moisture in the air is precipitated.
Consequently less trouble is experienced from condensation in
the discharge pipe.</p>

<p>A properly designed inter-cooler should reduce the air in
the cylinders to the temperature of the outside air. The economy
of compressing in several stages—or, in other words,
compound compressors—is shown from the fact that in compressing
air up to 100 lbs. the heat loss reaches about 30 per
cent. By compressing in two stages, this loss is cut down to
less than half; and in four stages, it is reduced to four or five
per cent. It is evident, therefore, that the higher the pressure
required the more essential is the use of compound machines.</p>

<p><em>The inter-cooler</em> is the vital feature of the two-stage or multi-stage
machine. In this construction the air is partially compressed
in one cylinder; it is then passed through an inter-cooler
where it is cooled and finally is compressed to the desired
degree in the second or other additional cylinders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>An inter-cooler is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_373">373</a>. The cooling surface
consists of a nest of small brass water tubes. These tubes break
up the stream of air entering the cooler, while their thin walls
insure rapid conduction. The receiver volume formed by the
connecting pipes and inter-cooler body results in a nearly uniform
discharge pressure in the low-pressure cylinder. The air
being outside of the tubes encounters practically no frictional
resistance, and its slow passage allows time for cooling. A
pocket, with gauge glass attached, is so placed as to catch any
precipitated moisture which might otherwise enter the high-pressure
cylinder.</p>

<p><em>An after-cooler</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_374">374</a>. This serves to reduce
the temperature of the air after the final compression.</p>

<p><em>The heat of compression</em>, as may be judged from the foregoing,
relating to inter and after-coolers is a feature of interest.
The temperature to which it finally attains depends, 1, upon
the initial temperature; 2, upon the degree of compression, or in
other words, <em>the amount of work expended</em> upon the compression.</p>

<p>The extent of this heating is shown in the following table,
<em>for dry air</em> when compression is performed with no cooling.</p>

<p><em>The Norwalk compound compressor</em> is shown in outline by
the cut 375. The large air cylinder on the left determines the
capacity of the compressor; for illustration assume its piston at
100 square inches area; the small air cylinder can have an area
of thirty-three and one-third square inches.</p>

<p><em>The small piston only encounters the heaviest pressure</em>; at
100 pounds pressure the resistance to its advance is 3,333
pounds. <em>The resistance against the large piston is its area
multiplied by the pressure which is caused by forcing the air
from the large cylinder into the smaller cylinder.</em> In this case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
it is thirty pounds per square inch. But as this thirty pounds
pressure acts on the back of the small piston, and hence assists
the machine, the net resistance to forcing the air from the large
into the small cylinder <em>is equal to the difference of the area of
the two pistons multiplied by the thirty pounds pressure</em>. This is
sixty-six and two-thirds by thirty, and equals 2,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Hence 2,000 pounds, the resistance to forcing the air from
the larger into the smaller cylinder, plus 3,333 pounds, the
resistance in the smaller cylinder to compressing it to 100
pounds, is the sum of all the resistances in the compound cylinders
at the time of greatest effort. This is 5,333 pounds.
By thus reducing the work to be done at the end of the stroke,
more work is done in the first part, and the resistance is made
nearly uniform for the whole stroke.</p>

<h3 id="THE_AIR_LIFT_PUMP">THE AIR LIFT PUMP.</h3></div>

<p>The Air Lift is one of the simplest methods of raising water
from underground sources. The main principle of its operation
may be stated thus: <em>air under pressure
is conveyed into the lower end
of the water pipe through a suitable
foot piece</em>.</p>

<p>City and town water works, asylums and hospitals, plantations,
railway water tanks, irrigation, private country houses, pumping mines,
ice manufactories, breweries, cold storage and packing houses, textile
mills, dye works, bleacheries, sewerage installations, dry docks,
seaside water works, stock farms; in fact, everywhere that clear and
abundant water is needed are opportunities for the application of the
Air Lift System of pumping water.</p>

<p>Nor is it alone for securing public water supplies that the Air
Lift is of special value. Within recent years the question of an
abundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> and pure water supply for manufacturing, irrigation
and other uses has become one of equal importance. After an extensive
experience, two general systems have been devised for utilizing the
water which lies immediately below the surface of the ground. One,
known as the Deep-well Pump System, for which a working pump is used,
and the other the Air Lift System, which employs compressed air to
raise the water, either by means of its inherent expansive force or the
difference in specific gravity between compressed air and water.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Dr. Julius J. Pohle is admitted to be the original inventor of this
admirable and useful device. At first all systems by which water or liquids
were lifted by compressed air were more or less extravagant, but with large
experience and with improvements in air compressor economy, the Air Lift
has made valuable strides. Dr. Pohle was actively associated with the
Ingersoll Sargeant Co. until his death, 1896, since which time his system has
been further improved and developed by a wider application and broader
experience.</p></div>

<p><em>Theory of the Air Lift.</em> Opinions differ as to the true theory of
the Air Lift. A common Air Lift case is one where there is a driven
well in which the water has risen approximately near the surface. In
this well is placed a large pipe for the discharge of the water, which
is known as an “<em>eduction pipe</em>.”</p>

<div class="nofloat"></div>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_378">
<img src="images/i_p080_fig378.jpg" width="150" height="207" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 378.</span></p></div>

<p>This pipe does not touch the bottom
of the well, but is elevated above
it so as to freely admit the water
through its lower
open end. Alongside
of this pipe, either on
the outside or within,
is a small pipe
properly proportioned
and intended to
convey compressed
air to a point near the bottom of the eduction pipe. It is usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
to provide a “foot-piece,” see Fig. <a href="#fig_378">378</a>, which forms a nozzle
connecting the air pipe with the water pipe, but in what is
known as the “central pipe system” this foot-piece is not
used, the air pipe being placed within the eduction-pipe to
a point near the bottom, where it discharges the compressed
air into the water column.</p>

<p>Many neighborhoods are dependent upon well water, and
there are few districts where an ample supply is not to be secured
from wells properly made; this water is generally pure and
wholesome. It is also of uniform temperature the year round—cool
and pleasant in the summer, because the underground pipe
and earth temperature remain uniformly low. In winter, well
water being warmer than that taken from ponds and rivers, is
not so apt to freeze, and, from all considerations of temperature
and purity, well water is greatly to be preferred. Many cities
located on rivers having a gravel bed formation find that, by
placing wells of suitable construction far enough back from the
bank, there is a natural filter bed, leaving the water clear, even
when the river itself is muddy. When river or other surface
water is good the wells may be sunk close to the edge, the
water flowing down from the top of the wells.</p>

<p>There are not many underground formations where wells
should be located close together. Such wells may affect or rob
each other, and it is usually best to spread them out on a line
across what is known to be the underground flow. Some finely
creviced or tight rock formations have a strong head with but
little capacity, and wells in such formations, if pumped hard,
yield but little additional water. They should be scattered
and pumped moderately, maintaining a low and economical
lift. In other cases, one well in a group will give as much
water as all together, and more territory must be drawn on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="figs_378_380_382_382">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 379-382.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The Pohle system of elevating liquids</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_377">377</a>.
The process “consists in submerging a portion of an open-ended
eduction-pipe in a body of the liquid to be raised and
continuously introducing into the liquid within the lower part
of the pipe a series of bubbles of compressed gaseous fluid containing
enough of the fluid to expand immediately across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
pipe and fill the same from side to side, forming pipe-fitting
piston-like layers at or just above the point of their entrance
into the pipe, whereby the column of liquid rising in the pipe
after the forcing out of the liquid first standing in the latter is
subdivided by the gaseous fluid into small portions before it
reaches the level of the liquid outside of the pipe, and a continuously
upward-flowing series of well-defined alternate layers
of gaseous fluid and short layers of liquid is formed and forced
up the pipe.”</p>

<p>The figures represent the apparatus in a state of action
pumping water, the shaded sections within the eduction-pipe,
W, representing water-layers and the intervening blank spaces
air-layers.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>At and before the beginning of pumping, the level of the water is the
same outside and inside of the discharge-pipe, W,—incidentally, also, in the
air pipe. Hence the vertical pressures per square inch are equal at the submerged
end of the discharge pipe. When, therefore, compressed air is admitted
into the air pipe, <em>a</em>, it must first expel the incidental standing water
before air can enter the eduction-pipe, W. When this has been accomplished,
the air-pressure is maintained until the water within the eduction-pipe
has been forced out, which it will be in one unbroken column, free
from air-bubbles.</p>

<p>When this has occurred the pressure of the air is lowered or its bulk diminished
and adjusted to a pressure just sufficient to overcome the external
water-pressure. It is thus adjusted for the performance of regular and uniform
work, which will ensue with the inflowing air and water, which adjust
themselves automatically in alternate layers or sections of definite lengths
and weights. It will be seen in the figures that the lengths of the water-columns
(shaded) and air (blank spaces) 1 and 1 are entered at the right of
the discharge-pipe, W; also, that under the pressure of two layers of water
1 and 2, the length of the air column 2 is 6.71 feet long, and so on. The
lengths of aggregate water columns and the air columns which they respectively
compress are also entered on the right of the water-pipe.</p>

<p>On the left of the water-pipe are entered the pressures per square inch of
these water columns or layers. Thus the pressure per square inch of column
1 is seen to be 1.74 pounds; that of 2, consisting of two columns or layers
1 and 2 each 4.02 feet long, to be 3.49 pounds, and that of 10, consisting of
nine columns or layers of water 1 to 9, inclusive, each 4.02 feet long, and
one of 3.80 feet in length (viz., layer 10) to be 17.35 pounds, and the aggregate
length of the layers of water is 39.98 feet in a total length of ninety-one
feet of pipe.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It will be noted that the length of pipe below the surface of the water in
the well is 55.5 feet, and that the difference between this and the aggregate
length of the water layers (39.98) is 15.52 feet—that is, on equal areas the
pressure outside of the pipe is greater than the pressure on the inside by the
weight due this difference of level, which is 47.65 pounds for the end of the
discharge pipe.</p>

<p>It is this difference of 15.52 feet, acting as a head that supplies the water
pipe, which puts the contents of the pipe in motion, and overcomes the resistance
in the pipe. In general the water layers are equal each to each, and the
pressure upon any layer of air is due to the number of water layers above it.</p>

<p>Thus the pressure upon the bottom layer of air 10 in the figure is due
to all the layers of water in the pipe (17.35 pounds), and the pressure upon
the uppermost layer of air 1 is due to the single layer of water, 1, at the
moment of its discharges beginning—viz., 1.74 pounds per square inch. As
this discharge progresses this is lessened, until at the completion of the discharge
of the water layer the air layer is of the same tension as the normal
atmosphere.</p></div>

<p><em>The air pipe</em> is connected with an air receiver on the surface,
which is at or near the engine room, in which there is <em>an
air compressor</em>. This air pipe is provided with a valve on the
surface. Before turning on the air the conditions in the well
show water at the same level on the outside and inside of the
eduction-pipe. At the first operation there must be sufficient
air pressure to discharge the column of water which stands in
the eduction-pipe.</p>

<p>This goes out <em>en masse</em>, after which the pump assumes a
normal condition, the air pressure being lowered and standing
at such a point as corresponds with the normal conditions in
the well. This is determined by the volume of water which
the well will yield in a certain time and the elevation to which
the water is discharged.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—This extended description of the principles upon which an air
lift operates—with its illustrations—is drawn almost word for word from the
original patent claims of Dr. Pohle. The occupation of the space in the
work is justified by the increasing importance of this system of water supply
and its practical applications in the industrial world.</p>

<p>Year by year the world’s visible supply of coal—so long stored and hidden
away in the earth’s crust awaiting the advent of man—is diminishing, next
will dawn the age of air and water with electric transmission.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>After the standing water column has been thrown off by the
pressure the air rises through the water reduces its weight,
with the result that the water is expelled as fast as the well
supplies it, <em>the water outside the pipe, acting as a head, flows
into the discharge pipe
by the force of gravity</em>.</p>

<p>The machinery necessary for a system of pumping comprises, 1, <em>an
air compressor</em>; 2, a receiver to store and equalize the pressure;
3, the head piece and foot piece for the well; and, 4, the necessary
piping for the air supply and water discharge.</p>

<p>With an available supply of air under pressure <em>the pump proper
consists of simply a water discharge and air pipe</em>, the latter arranged
and properly controlled to inject air into the former at the point
of proper submersion. It is readily seen that the apparatus<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span> is
so simple that as a pump it cannot get out of order; in cases, where
mud, sand or gritty material is encountered, it will handle such matter
<em>with the water</em> and without injury to the system, as nothing comes in
contact with the moving parts.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 384, 385.</span></p></div>

<p>Absence of all obstructing mechanism in the wells allows each to
be operated to its full capacity. Production, therefore, does not
depend upon the pump, but rather upon the capacity of the well to yield
water; the natural yield of wells is often increased by this process of
using compressed air admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87"
id="Page_87">87</a></span> close to the bottom of the discharge
pipe, the water is set in motion at a considerable depth, and by this
action the well is “cleaned.”</p>

<p><em>Purification is effected by aeration during the process of
pumping</em>, the absorption of air by the water preventing the
formation of unsanitary growths.</p>

<p><em>Three styles of well heads</em> are shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_383">383</a>, <a href="#figs_384_385">384</a> and
<a href="#figs_384_385">385</a>.</p>

<p><em>The deflector head</em>, Fig. <a href="#fig_383">383</a>, is attached to the well casing
or discharge pipe by standards. This form of head piece is
generally used where the water is to be raised to the surface,
or just below the surface into a tank, where the air is allowed
to separate itself, and the water flows to some central collecting
reservoir, where it is used or forced by means of an ordinary
pump to a higher elevation. The head piece offers no obstruction
to the discharged water.</p>

<p><em>The offset discharge</em>, Fig. <a href="#figs_384_385">384</a>, is adapted to situations where
the water is to be pumped by air direct from the well to some
elevation above the well.</p>

<p><em>The elbow discharge</em>, Fig. <a href="#figs_384_385">385</a>, shows the common form of
well head known as the elbow head, adapted to be used either
as a cap for the well casing itself, or used in connection with a
suitable discharge pipe.</p>

<p><em>The foot piece, or nozzle</em>, which regulates the admission of
air to the discharge pipe at the point where the air comes in
contact with the water, thereby makes it possible to carry air
at full pressure to the end of the air pipe, and utilizes the
energy due to the velocity of the discharged air.</p>

<p><em>After a well is once regulated or balanced</em> there is but little
occasion to move the adjusting wheel or valve, the starting and
stopping of the flow of any particular well being accomplished
by means of an ordinary valve or plug cock on the air pipe at
or adjacent to the well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p><em>One Central Station of suitable capacity will operate several
wells no matter how far apart.</em> The necessity of maintaining
a number of separate pumping plants is thus done away with,
and in taking a supply of water from an underground source
the wells can be located without reference to the power plant,
and at such distances apart as will best maintain the highest
average pumping level.</p>

<p>Although the principle of the action governing all pumps of
this description is so simple, there are a number of factors having
a direct influence upon the performance of the pump, which
have been expressed in the following terms by a well-known

<p>It was at first supposed that in all Air Lift cases the water
was discharged because of the aeration of the water in the
eduction-pipe, due to the intimate co-mingling of air and water.
Bubbles of air rising in a water column not only have a tendency
to carry particles of water with the air, but the column is
made lighter, and, with a submergence or weight of water on
the outside of the eduction-pipe, there would naturally be a
constant discharge of air and water. This is known as the
Frizell System, and where the lifts are moderate—that is, where
the water in the well reaches a point near the surface—it is very
likely that the discharge is due to simple aeration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>Most air lift propositions are deep-well cases—that is, the
water is lifted a distance greater than 25 feet; and just in proportion
as the lift is increased do we get away from the aerated
form idea, and so when the air pressure is greater than the head
of water, a certain volume of compressed air is received into
the eduction-pipe, the water in this pipe is at that time moving
rapidly upward; that is, its momentum has been established.
Hence the air takes up this velocity and goes upward with the
water from the energy received from the elasticity of the air
due to its compressor.</p>

<p>A practical example of the successful working of an air
compressor for raising water from a driven well 319 feet is
described and illustrated by the <em>Practical
Engineer</em> as shown in the sketch, Fig. <a href="#fig_386">386</a>.</p>

<p>The air compressor forces the air down the inside pipe, which is
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>″ in diameter. The outside pipe,
which is 3″ in diameter, has its lower end submerged in the well. The
compressed air forces a rising column of air mingled with water in the
outer pipe to the supply tanks, which are situated at the top of the
building.</p>

<p><em>Direct Air Pressure Pumps.</em> This term is applied to that class
of pumps in which the liquid is taken into an air tight vessel and
then driven out through pipes to a higher level by the application of
compressed air directly on the surface of the liquid in the tank, thus
dispensing with cylinders, pistons, valves, glands, etc., of the more
common class of pumps.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_387">
<img src="images/i_p090.jpg" width="335" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 387.</span></p></div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_387">387</a> shows the parts of the pump; its operation is as follows:
Suppose the compressor to be in operation and the switch set as in the
figure; the air will be drawn out of the right tank and forced into the
left tank, and in so doing will draw water into the former and force it
out of the latter. The charge of air in the system is so adjusted that
when one tank is emptied the other is filled, and at that moment the
switch will be automatically thrown, reversing the pipe connections and
thereby reversing the action in the tanks.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><em>The switch</em> is a simple mechanism placed on the air pipes near the
compressor. It can be automatically operated in one of three ways:</p>

<p><em>First</em>, by means of the suction which occurs in the intake pipe to
the compressor, when water is drawn above its outside level in one of
the tanks. The details of the mechanism to utilize this suction are
very simple.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, by a mechanism, that will throw the switch at some
assigned number of strokes of the compressor, the proper number
being that which will empty one tank and fill the other. This can be
closely computed beforehand and can be determined exactly by test when
commencing operation and the switch adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>, by an electrically controlled mechanism, the circuit
being made and broken by a pressure gauge on the intake of the
compressor.</p></div>

<p>The Pneumatic Engineering Co. are the makers of this
apparatus, named <em>the Harris System</em> of raising water by direct
pressure.</p>

<h3>THE STEAM FIRE ENGINE.</h3></div>

<p>The steam fire engine is practically a portable pumping
engine. <em>It is in all respects a complete water works on a small
scale</em>, hence, a modern apparatus must, within itself, and each
part working harmoniously with every other part, contain
several complex mechanisms. This will readily appear by a
study of the several succeeding illustrations; the first, which in
the figure below exhibits a “view” of a complete machine.</p>

“double extra first,” etc.; their capacities and weights are given
approximately in the following</p>

<p>The foregoing list of the sizes, capacities, etc., of the fire
apparatus now in general use, affords a very good comparison
between it and that which has, little by little, progressed for
two thousand years to its present high plane. <em>The application
of electric power to the operation of the pumps</em> and the propulsion
of the apparatus is yet in too elementary a stage for present
discussion in a work of this scope for—</p>

<p>It is essential that the machinery relied upon for fire protection
should at all times be ready for instantaneous and
effective service; this, because both life and vast property
interests are at stake, <em>hence of all machines
made, the modern steam fire engine is
produced with a niceness of finish and accuracy
of fit equaled by no other</em>, when
size is considered; it approaches towards
the perfection seen in the mechanism of
a fine watch.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="figs_390_391">
<img src="images/i_p094.jpg" width="200" height="395" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 390, 391.</span></p></div>

<p>This degree of excellence has been
arrived at by successive steps. The
illustration on page 92, Fig. <a href="#fig_388">388</a> exhibits
the fire-fighting tools of the early Romans
and similar apparatus was used in England
as late as the fifteenth century. The
implements shown are a syringe, a sledge
hammer, two fire hooks and three leathern
buckets conveniently arranged against a wall. <em>The owners of
houses or chimneys that took fire were fined</em>; and men were
appointed to watch for fires and give the alarm. In 1472 a
night bellman was employed in Exeter to alarm the inhabitants
in case of fire, and in 1558, leathern buckets, ladders
and crooks, were ordered to be provided for the same city;
no application of the pump seems to have been then thought of.</p>

<p>Syringes continued to be used in London till the latter part
of the 17th century, when they were superseded by more improved
machines. They were usually made of brass and held
from two to four quarts. The smaller ones were about two
feet and a half long, and an inch and a half in diameter; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
bore of the nozzles being half an inch. <em>Three men</em> were required
to work each, which they achieved in this manner: one
man on each side, grasped the cylinder with one hand and the
nozzle with the other; while the third man worked the piston!
Those who held the instrument plunged the nozzle into a
vessel of water, the operator then drew back the piston and
thus charged the cylinder, and when it was raised by the
bearers into the required position, he pushed in the piston
and forced, or rather endeavored to force, the contents upon
the fire.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">A</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_392">
<img src="images/i_p095.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 392.</span></p></div>

<p>Figs. <a href="#figs_390_391">390</a> and <a href="#figs_390_391">391</a> show an early form of syringe. A description
of it translated from the original Greek, written by
Hero of the ancient city of Alexandria, reads thus—“A hollow
tube of some length is made, A, B; into this another tube, C, D,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
is nicely fitted, to the extremity of which is fastened a small
plate or piston; at, D, is a handle, E, F. Cover the orifice, A,
of the tube, A, B, with a plate in which an extremely fine tube,
G, H, is fixed, its bore communicating with A, B, through the
plate—as a vacuum is thus produced in A, B, something
else must enter to fill it, and as there is no other passage but
through the mouth of the small tube we shall of necessity draw
up through this any fluid that may be near.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">A</span></a> <span class="smcap">Note.</span>—We are told that some of these syringes are preserved in one or
two of the parish churches. It can excite no surprise that London should
have been almost wholly destroyed in the great fire of 1666, when such were
the machines upon which the inhabitants chiefly depended for protecting
their property and dwellings. If the diminutive size of these instruments
be considered, the number of hands required to work each, beside others to
carry water and vessels for them, the difficulty and often impossibility of
approaching sufficiently near so as to reach the flames with the jet, the loss
of part of the stream at the beginning and end of each stroke of the piston,
and the trifling effect produced—the whole act of using them, appears rather
as a farce. These primitive devices were known as “hand squirts.”</p></div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_392">392</a> is a copy of an old engraving (A. D. 1568) which
shows an “engine” of this type sufficiently enlarged to contain
a barrel or more of water and as a matter of necessity, placed
on a carriage.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_393">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 393.</span></p></div>

<p>To eject the water uniformly, the inventor moved the piston by a screw;
and when the cylinder was emptied, it was refilled through the funnel
by an attendant, as the piston was drawn back by reversing the motion
of the crank. When recharged, the stop cock in the pipe of the funnel
was closed and the liquid forced out as before. As flexible pipes of
leather, the “ball and socket”

and “goose-neck” joints had not been introduced, some mode
of <em>changing the direction of the jet</em> of this enormous syringe
was necessary. To effect this, it is represented as suspended
on pivots, fastened in two upright posts: to these are secured
(see <a href="#fig_393">figure</a>) two semi-circular straps of iron, whose centers coincide
with the axis, or pivots, on which the syringe is balanced.
A number of holes are made in each, and are so arranged as to
be opposite each other. A bolt is passed through two of these,
and also through a similar hole, in a piece of metal, that is
firmly secured to the upper part of the open end of the cylinder;
and thus holds the latter in any required position. The iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
frame to which the box or female part of the screw is attached,
is made fast to the cylinder; and it is through a projecting
piece on the end of this frame that the bolt is passed. By these
means, any elevation could be given to the nozzle, and the
syringe could be secured by passing the bolt through the piece
just mentioned, and through the corresponding holes in the
straps. When a <em>lateral</em> change in the jet was required, the
whole machine was moved by a man at the end of the pole, as
in the figure. Jointed feet were attached to the frame which
were let down when the engine was at work.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_393">393</a> shows an engine for extinguishing fires, which has
come down to us from the times of Hero, who thus describes it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The siphons used in conflagrations are made as follows. Take
two vessels of bronze, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B C D</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">E F G H</span> (Fig. <a href="#fig_393">393</a>), having the inner surface
bored in a lathe to fit a piston (like the barrels of water-organs), <span class="smcap lowercase">K L</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">M N</span>,
being the pistons fitted to the boxes. Let the cylinders communicate with
each other by means of the tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">X O D F</span>, and be provided with valves, <span class="smcap lowercase">P</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>,
such as have been explained above, within the tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">X O D F</span>, and opening
outwards from the cylinders. In the bases of the cylinders pierce circular
apertures, <span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, covered with polished hemispherical cups, <span class="smcap lowercase">V Q</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">W Y</span>, through
which insert spindles soldered to, or in some way connected with, the bases
of the cylinders, and provided with shoulders at the extremities that the
cups may not be forced off the spindles. To the center of the pistons fasten
the vertical rods, <span class="smcap lowercase">S E</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">S E</span>, and attach to these the beam <span class="smcap lowercase">A&acute; A&acute;</span>, working, at
its center, about the stationary pin, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, and about the pins, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, at the rods,
<span class="smcap lowercase">S E</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">S E</span>. Let the vertical tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">S&acute; E&acute;</span>, communicate with the tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">X O D F</span>,
branching into two arms at, <span class="smcap lowercase">S&acute;</span>, and provided with small pipes through
which to force up water, such as were explained above in the description of
the machine for producing a water-jet by means of the compressed air.</p>

<p>Now, if the cylinders, provided with these additions be plunged into a
vessel containing water, <span class="smcap lowercase">I J U Z</span>, and the beam, <span class="smcap lowercase">A&acute; A&acute;</span>, be made to work at its
extremities, <span class="smcap lowercase">A&acute;</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A&acute;</span>, which move alternately about the pin, <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, the pistons, as
they descend, will drive out the water through the tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">E&acute; S</span>, and the revolving
mouth, <span class="smcap lowercase">M&acute;</span>. For when the piston, <span class="smcap lowercase">M N</span>, ascends it opens the aperture,
<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, as the cup, <span class="smcap lowercase">W Y</span>, rises, and shuts the valve, <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>; but when it descends it
shuts, <span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>, and opens, <span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>, through which the water is driven and forced upwards.
The action of the other piston, <span class="smcap lowercase">K L</span>, is the same. Now the small
pipe, <span class="smcap lowercase">M&acute;</span>, which waves backward and forward, ejects the water to the required
height but not in the required direction, unless the whole machine
be turned round; which on urgent occasions is a tedious and difficult process.
In order therefore, that the water may be ejected to the spot required,
let the tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">E&acute; S&acute;</span>, consist of two tubes, fitting closely together lengthwise,
of which one must be attached to the tube, <span class="smcap lowercase">X O D F</span>, and the other to the
part from which the arms branch off at, <span class="smcap lowercase">S&acute;</span>; and thus, if the upper tube be
turned round, by the inclination of the mouthpiece, <span class="smcap lowercase">M&acute;</span>, the stream of water
can be forced to any spot we please. The upper joint of the double tube
must be secured to the lower to prevent its being forced from the machine
by the violence of the water. This may be effected by holdfasts in the shape
of the letter <span class="smcap lowercase">L</span>, soldered to the upper tube, and sliding on a ring which
encircles the lower.</p></div>

<p>Heron or Hero was an Alexandrian mathematician of the
3d Century <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> He was the inventor of “Hero’s Fountain”
in which a jet of water was maintained by condensed air and of
a machine acting upon the principle of Barker’s Mill, in which
the motion was produced by steam. <em>Fragments of his works
on mechanics have been preserved</em> for more than 2000 years.</p>

<p>Lack of space forbids following, as could be done, the
growth of the modern steam fire engine from these primitive
beginnings to its present high point of excellence and widely
extended use. Wherever civilized men are gathered into towns
and cities there can be found this admirable mechanism affording
protection to both life and property.</p>

<p>The Working Parts,<br />
<span class="add2em">The Boiler, and</span><br />
<span class="add3em">Its</span> facilities for Transportation are the three essential parts of
the one mechanism which combined, form the steam fire engine. In
brief reference to the last qualification, it may be said that these
engines are drawn by hand, by one or more horses, or other animals and
<em>are self-propelled by both steam and electric power</em>; again the hose
carriage can be drawn by hand, by horses or can be attached to the
engine.</p>

<p><em>The main working parts of the machine</em> can be easily divided
into two parts, <em>the engine</em> and <em>the pump</em>.</p>

<p>The boiler in all its details has been designed to meet the
requirements peculiar to the fire service and needs a full explanation
with illustrations.</p>

<p><em>The auxiliary appliances</em> found necessary for the operation
of the modern steam fire engine are large in number; this is
owing to the fact that the machine combines within itself so
complete a system for extinguishing fires. <em>The supplies</em> needed
for its maintenance and use are also in proportion, as to quantity
and variety, to its complex make up.</p>

<p><em>The boiler</em>, which is generally of the upright semi-water
tube type, is combined with the engine by means of a strong
iron frame, which carries all the appliances as well as the
driver’s seat, and also forms the body of the truck.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 395.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The pumps</em> may be of the reciprocating or rotary type, and are
generally placed in front of the boiler. If of the reciprocating type,
two pumps are placed alongside each other, and are operated either by a
double slide valve or piston valve engine.</p>

<p><em>The piston rods</em> connect directly with the plunger rods and are
also connected to a crank shaft by means of either connecting rods
or yokes, the cranks being set at right angles, so that one pump is
always acting, while the other passes the dead center, thus giving a
practically steady stream.</p>

<p><em>The engine exhausts into the stack</em>, which gives the necessary

draft. Some engines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
are equipped with a boiler feed pump, others only depend
upon an injector, or feed directly from the main pump.
<em>The coal box</em>, which also forms a platform for the engineer to
stand upon while under way, is placed back of the boiler.</p>

<p><em>All engines are equipped with two suctions and two discharge
openings</em>, so that either side may be connected up. The tool box and
driver’s seat are in front of the engine. The frame rests upon springs,
to make the machine easy running.</p>

<p><em>The Fox Boiler</em> with which the Metropolitan and other engines are
equipped deserves an extended notice. It is shown in vertical section
in Fig. <a href="#fig_395">395</a>, the arrows indicating the steam and water circulation.
Its design, while simple, embodies some original ideas as to the
arrangement of the tube surface method of circulation, etc.; it is
a steam generator of <em>the water tube type</em> designed to meet<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the requirements peculiar to the fire service. The steam take-off
and sectional view of shell with the tube system removed is
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_397">397</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Working pressure can be generated in this boiler in six minutes
from cold water, and the provisions for expansion are so near perfect that no
bad effect is noticeable from such severe treatment. The manifold tube
sections are tested to 600 pounds pressure, and are put together with great
care; <em>the manifolds are counter-bored</em> to admit the full diameter of the
tube, leaving none of the threaded portion exposed.</p></div>

<p>The boiler consists primarily of a simple annular shell heavily
stay-bolted throughout, and constitutes a water-legged fire-box and
steam reservoir; the principal heating surface of the boiler consists
of straight water tubes, manifolded in sectional form and housed within
the shell, the general scheme providing arrangements to make all
connections readily accessible, and permitting the withdrawal from the
boiler of any one or all of the several tube sections; the shell, being
practically a permanent feature, need seldom be disturbed by reason of
subsequent repairs or renewals of the tube systems.</p>

<p>It may be noted that the lower part, or water leg, of the shell is
contracted for the purpose of facilitating the rapid generation of
steam, and also providing the maximum grate area; at a point somewhat
below the water line of the boiler, the inner shell is flanged inward,
thereby enlarging the annular space between the inner and outer sheets
for the purpose of providing a more copious reservoir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>The water line being carried in this larger part of the shell,
tends to prevent the rapid fluctuation of the water level, and
the increased area of its surface at this point is favorable to the
disengagement of the steam.</p>

<p>When held at its normal point, the water line protects the
flanged part of the inner shell; but no damage can occur, either
from a willful or an accidental
drawing down of
the water, as the spray deflected
through the nipples
of the outer tubes is sufficient
to protect the flange, although
the actual water level
is well down in the leg.</p>

<p>The steam in contact with
the upper part of the shell is
by no means dry, and the
heat absorbed at this point is
amply sufficient to protect it.
To insure a delivery of dry
steam to the cylinders, a
peculiar <em>“take-off” ring</em> is
provided at the highest part
of the steam reservoir, the
same encircling the inside
sheet of the shell. The upper edge of the
ring is perforated at a distant point from
the throttle, and the steam entering the
ring chamber in small streams is held in
close contact with the hot shell at a point
closely adjacent to the upper line of rivets;
the steam by this means is dried during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
its passage to the throttle, and the heat thus absorbed serves
as a protection to the rivets just referred to.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The life of both water tubes and fire tubes is generally found
disproportionate to the heavier parts used in boiler construction, and experience
shows conclusively that the cost of subsequent maintenance is measured
directly by, and may be diminished by, the facility with which these indispensable
parts may be replaced or repaired in an emergency.</p></div>

<p>The principal heating surface of the boiler is contained in
the vertical water tube sections, which comprise and will be
referred to, as <em>an inner and an outer tube system</em>.</p>

<p><em>The outer system</em>, embraces the short manifold sections which
completely encircle the fire-box walls. The top end of each
section is screwed and suspended from the flanged part of the
shell, and the lower end is stayed by direct connection with
the leg of the fire-box. <em>The tubes are “staggered”</em> in their
manifolds, thereby exposing the greatest possible surface to
the fire, and filling out the space due to the difference in the
width of the water-leg and steam space of the shell.</p>

<p>The direct application of heat to the tubes causes a natural
and active upward current therein, which in turn induces a corresponding
downward movement of the water in the leg of the
fire-box, and promotes the flow into the feed pipes.</p>

<p class="caption">Bottom View.—<span class="smcap">Fig. 402.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The inner-tube system</em> comprises those tube sections which
extend to the upper limits of the boiler, their number and
arrangement being such as to completely fill the interior of the
shell above the space required for the combustion of the fuel.
The construction of the vertical inner-tube system is simple,
and consists of the required number of manifold sections, suitably
arranged to conform to the circular space occupied, the
flat inner end of each upper manifold being rigidly bolted to a
heavy transverse beam, which in turn is supported in suitable
pockets secured to the upper part of the shell.</p>

<p>At the top of the boiler, each section has its own connection
with the steam space, and it is easy to remove either one
of the sections separately without disturbing the others; <em>or the
entire inner-tube system can be raised out of the boiler as a whole,
after breaking the proper connections</em>, all of which are accessible.
The current of steam and water carried over through the top
connections of the inner system is generally sufficient to keep
the tubes clear of scale; and the point of discharge and disengagement
is brought down low, to prevent its mixture with the
drier steam contained in the highest part of the shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>When connected to a stationary boiler, as is now the general
practice in fire departments, the circulative currents of
water reach all parts of the boiler, hence its contents may be
kept uniformly at any desirable temperature.</p>

<p><em>A stationary heater for the fire engine</em> consists of a small
boiler, placed at some convenient point near the same when in quarters.
It is connected with the engine boiler by means of suitable circulating
pipes, the entire arrangement being adapted to supply hot water through
pipe connections which separate automatically as the engine leaves the
house.</p>

<p>Although the best types of fire engine boilers require but a few
minutes’ time to generate a working pressure from cold water, the
general adoption of many improvements has made the stationary heater an
essential part of a complete equipment.</p>

<p>Experience proves that the life of the boiler is prolonged by being
kept constantly in a state of activity, and the elevated temperature of
the water insures prompt and efficient work by the steamer at the very
time when a few moments’ delay may breed disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p><em>The pumps</em> fitted and adapted to steam fire engines comprise
two separate and distinct double acting piston pumps united in
a single body and akin in many details to the duplex pump.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_403">
<img src="images/i_p106.jpg" width="251" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 403.</span></p></div>

<p>Calling in mind the well-known fact, that, in drawing a water supply
the only power available to bring the fluid under forcing influence of
the pump’s pistons is the limited pressure of the atmosphere, therefore
the importance of all details concerned in first inducing an entry of
the water will be readily conceded. Easy and unrestricted “suction
ways” in direct communication with properly proportioned receiving
valves (and these valves suitably arranged in close proximity to the
working barrels of the pump), are the conditions that must always
remain paramount, and to which all other features must give way, to
safely attain the desirable high piston speeds. The value of perfect,
simple and direct water ways, the passages, and all which they imply,
has been studied in the design of this pumping engine. See Figs.
<a href="#fig_403">403</a>-<a href="#figs_404_405_406_407">407</a>.</p>

<p>The facilities provided for exposing the interior mechanism<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
permits all such parts to be quickly reached for examination,
or detached for renewal or repair, and this can be done without
dismounting the entire pumps or greatly disturbing their exterior
attachments. It will be seen, by reference to the cuts, that all of
the valves can be easily and quickly examined, and also replaced, by
removing the caps that enclose the chambers; all joints required for
this purpose are made between flat surfaces planed true, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#figs_404_405_406_407">404</a>; gun metal, or other suitable composition, is used and no part
of the pump body is subject to wear, either by friction or corrosion.
<em>All valve seats are screwed into place</em>, and either these or the
working barrels of the pump may be readily replaced with new ones, in
case the same should become worn. All stud bolts, nuts, etc., coming
in contact with water, are made of drawn phosphor or Tobin bronze;
nipples, piping, etc., are of brass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="figs_404_405_406_407">
<img src="images/i_p107_figs_404_405_406_407.jpg" width="367" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 404, 405, 406</span> and <span class="smcap">407</span>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Suction or hydrant connection may be made at either side
of the engine; and, in operation, the central core of the pump
body is <em>practically a continuation of the suction hose</em>, and serves
to establish a direct communication with the receiving pump
valves, arranged on opposite sides of the chamber. This
chamber, as shown in the sectional view, Fig. <a href="#fig_408">408</a>, thus <em>becomes
the distributing center, from which the incoming water flows to
the suction valves</em>. The current from the suction is not required
to change its general direction, and but little friction is
encountered by the water in its diversion through the pump
valves.</p>

<p>The position of the suction or receiving valves, in relation
to the water cylinders, may be understood by reference to
Fig. <a href="#fig_408">408</a>, which shows the same arranged in a cluster around
the open ends of the barrels. The suction valve area is large,
and the proportions adopted contribute largely to the smooth
running of the pump, under conditions of speed seldom attempted
in ordinary practice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_408">
<img src="images/i_p108.jpg" width="600" height="312" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 408.</span></p></div>

<p>The valves in this pump are controlled by improved springs,
the tension of which is at all times the same; and which are
made of phosphor bronze; <em>the force chambers</em> in opposite ends
of the pumps are practically equal, and, owing to the close proximity
of the valves, the clearance is reduced to a minimum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
The discharging outlets are elevated above the highest point of
the valve chambers, and the communicating passages are designed
to prevent conflicting currents, and also to permit the pump
to free itself promptly of air. The pistons are of a frictionless
type, and in accordance with the usual practice of working
double pumps in unison, the cranks controlling the movements
of the pistons are placed at 90 degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_409">
<img src="images/i_p109.jpg" width="600" height="317" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 409.</span></p></div>

<p>A convenient and effective arrangement of suction strainers
is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_409">409</a>. Perforated cages are introduced into the
suction chambers through the inlets on opposite sides of the
pump. The ends of these cages are open, and a short sleeve,
which is permanently secured within the pump, serves to support
and also to establish communication from one cage to the
other.</p>

<p>The surface of both cages is, therefore, available as a
strainer, and any obstruction entering with the water is carried
to the opposite side, to a point where it can be removed, without
first detaching the suction hose.</p>

<p>The driving mechanism supplied with the American Pump
is shown by Figs. <a href="#fig_389">389</a> and <a href="#fig_394">394</a>, which are perspective views engraved
from photographs. It may be noted that the design is
practically compact and well balanced, and embodies many excellent
advantages found in no other type of fire engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p><em>The pumps, steam cylinders and driving parts</em> are built as a
unit, and have no direct connection with the boiler other than
the necessary stays and pipe connections, all of which are
readily accessible and visible for inspection at any time.</p>

<p>The steam cylinders used in connection with the pumps are
of the ordinary slide valve type. The valve chests are easily
opened from either side of the engine for examination, and the
valve rods are made from a special composition and can not
corrode. The valve motion is simple, and there is nothing connected
with the steam ends that may not be quickly understood.</p>

<h3>THE SILSBY ROTARY STEAM FIRE ENGINE.</h3></div>

<p>The distinguishing feature of this engine will be found in
the fact that, in both the cylinder and pump, the rotary type
is substituted for the reciprocating or piston principle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_412">
<img src="images/i_p113_fig_412.jpg" width="450" height="307" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 412.</span></p></div>

<p>The larger sizes of these engines, Fig. <a href="#fig_411">411</a>, are hung on platform
truck springs in front and on half-elliptic springs in the rear, and
are braced and stayed to withstand violent shocks in the rapid driving
over pavements. Although fitted to be drawn by

horses only, they can be supplied with rope reel and drag rope.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_413">
<img src="images/i_p113_fig_413.jpg" width="450" height="358" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 413.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The Silsby steam cylinder</em> consists of two rotary pistons or cams,
mounted on steel shafts and working together within an elliptical
steam-tight case. Live steam from the boiler enters at the bottom
of this case, and in its passage presses apart their long teeth or
abutments, causes the two cams to rotate, and exhausts from the top
into the tank and feed-water heater; these cams are provided with
teeth or cogs, adapted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114"
id="Page_114">114</a></span> to mesh with corresponding recesses
in each other, so that a steam tight joint is maintained between them
and leakage thereby prevented from passing directly upward into the
exhaust.</p>

<p>The sides of these cams have their arcs turned to fit the heads
of the case, and are so adjusted that, while being practically steam
tight, allowance is made for expansion and contraction. In the ends of
the longest teeth of the revolving cams are placed removable packing
strips, which are forced outward into contact with the cylinder walls
by means of springs. These packing strips may be removed through
openings in the sides of the cylinder, and readjusted to take up the
wear, which is confined to the ends of these adjustable strips. This
can be done without taking the pump or cylinder apart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_414">
<img src="images/i_p114.jpg" width="285" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 414.</span></p></div>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_415">
<img src="images/i_p115.jpg" width="71" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 415.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The construction of the pump is similar to</em><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
<em>that of the cylinder</em>; in this there are three long teeth in each cam
instead of two. One shaft of the pump is coupled to the corresponding
shaft of the cylinder, there being outside gears on both cylinder
and pump to compel a uniform motion of the cams and to equalize the
pressure. This construction secures a transmission of power at once
direct and positive in Fig. <a href="#fig_412">412</a>.</p>

<p>The stuffing-boxes, used on both cylinder and pump, are
self-adjusting, reduce friction and insure tightness. Valves are
entirely absent from the pump and cylinder. The water ways being large,
anything liable to enter the suction will pass through the pump without
injury or interruption; the pump requires no priming, but when started
will immediately without the aid of a check valve lift water vertically
any required distance up to 29 feet.</p>

<p><em>The construction of the boiler</em> ordinarily supplied with this
engine is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_414">414</a>-<a href="#fig_415">415</a>. In the fire-box hangs a series of
circulating water tubes arranged in concentric circles and securely
screwed into the crown sheet. These drop tubes are closed at their
lower ends by means of wrought-iron plugs welded in, and within each of
them is placed a much smaller and thinner tube, which latter is open at
both ends. The cooler water in the boiler descends through the inner
tube and is thus brought directly into the hottest part of the furnace,
whence, after being for the most part converted into steam, it ascends
through the annular spaces between these inner and outer tubes.</p>

<p><em>The gases of combustion</em> pass from the fire
box to the stack through smoke flues, the lower
ends of which are expanded into the crown
sheet, and the upper ends into the top head of the boiler.</p>

<p>N.B.—Mr. <span class="smcap">John R. Freeman</span>, member of the New England Waterworks Association, should have
the credit of this carefully arranged table.—See also page <a href="#Page_125">125</a> for data relating to Nozzles.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p><em>The Clapp &amp; Jones piston engine</em> in design has features
peculiar to itself; Fig. <a href="#fig_416">416</a> represents one of six sizes, adapted
particularly to city service.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_417">
<img src="images/i_p118.jpg" width="256" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 417.</span></p></div>

<p>The illustrations, Figs. <a href="#fig_417">417</a> and <a href="#fig_418">418</a>, <em>show the vertical pump</em> as
built for the larger engines: namely, the sizes known as Extra First,
First, Second, Third and Fourth. The complete engine corresponding to
the detailed views is shown by Fig. <a href="#fig_416">416</a> on the preceding page.</p>

<p>The principal details are very clear in this engraving. The steam
and water ends, together with the crank and reciprocating mechanism,
are compactly arranged and the complete structure which comprises these
parts is rigidly self-contained. The steam cylinders and valve chest
are cast in a single piece and while this part is firmly secured to the
boiler, all steam and exhaust connections are entirely independent of
these fastenings.</p>

<p><em>The Clapp boiler</em> is represented in Fig. <a href="#fig_419">419</a>. Reference to
the annexed illustration makes clear the special features of this
boiler, which consist chiefly of a series of spiral water-tube coils
arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> within the fire-box. The coils are of copper and
are produced by the seamless drawn process. Each coil is connected
separately to the boiler, and the spiral form of these tubes permits
freedom for expansion and contraction without strain on the terminal
joints. The connections and the ends of the tubes are made by means
of threaded nipples, jam nuts and corrugated copper washers, and the
joints thus made insure tightness, yet admit of ready disconnection at
any time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_418">
<img src="images/i_p119.jpg" width="336" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 418.</span></p></div>

<p>The lower ends of the coil tubes are directly joined to the hollow
fire-box walls and the upper terminals are arranged to discharge the
circulated water over the crown sheet. This upward movement of the
water within the spiral coils is caused<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span> by the application of
heat to the outer surfaces of the tubes, and the circulation thus set
up induces <em>a corresponding downward action in the leg of the boiler</em>.
The circulation, therefore, continues without interruption so long as
fire is maintained on the grate. In operating this boiler the water
should be carried a few inches above the level of the crown sheet, but
owing to the protection afforded by the constant distribution of water
over the crown sheet, the limit of safety is not reached until the
water is nearly out of the fire-box leg.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_419">
<img src="images/i_p120.jpg" width="258" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 419.</span></p></div>

<p>An improvement in the design of this boiler is <em>the
water-circulating deflector</em>, which was devised to occupy the central
space within the coil tubes. This deflector comprises an additional
sectional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[
121]</a></span> unit, and its action coincides with the functions
served by the coil tubes. The prime object of this device is to break
up and direct the gases of combustion in a manner that adds to the
heat-absorbing qualities of the coil tubes. See Figs. <a href="#fig_420">420</a>, <a href="#fig_421">421</a>.</p>

<p>Extending from the crown sheet to the top head are the smoke flues,
which are securely expanded at both ends, and through which the gases
of combustion pass from the fire box to the stack.</p>

<p><em>The Clapp &amp; Jones Village Engine.</em> By the illustrations, Figs.
<a href="#fig_422">422</a>, <a href="#fig_423">423</a>, <a href="#fig_424">424</a>, etc., it will be noted that the cylinders and pumps are
disposed horizontally and are fitted in a self-contained manner between
bars, which also serve as the main frame of the engine.</p>

<p>The steam cylinders are 8 inches diameter; the pumps
4<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches, and the stroke common to both
is 7 inches. These sizes are properly proportioned for effective work
and the boiler power provided is ample to drive the pumping mechanism
to its rated capacity of 400 gallons per minute.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 421.</span></p></div>

<p>The pumps are fitted with gates permitting two lines of hose to be
worked either independently or at the same time without interference.
The machine is mounted on half-elliptic springs, front and rear,
and the weight of the boiler and pumps is distributed equally over
both axles. The front pair of wheels turn completely under the goose
necks, and the engine can therefore be turned on either hind wheel as
a pivot. The arch of the main frames under which the wheels pass in
turning is immediately forward of the boiler, and the advantage to be
noted in this connection is the reduction in the over-all length of
the entire machine. The front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122"
id="Page_122">122</a></span> axle is equipped with a rope reel,
and the pole is arranged for either hand or horse draft. The wheels are
fitted with brakes, which are operated from the rear footboard. The
engine weighs about 4,400 pounds. A detail description of the pump and
valve gear follows.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 422.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The valve gear of the Clapp &amp; Jones village engine</em> is simple
yet controls the moving mechanism of the two pumps working
in unison. Each pump is driven
directly by its own steam cylinder,
and the steam valves are actuated
by the positive movement of the
opposite piston rod. The principle
is substantially the same as practiced
in the “Duplex” pump construction,
and may be readily understood by reference to the
detailed views which are given of these parts in other portions
of this work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_423">
<img src="images/i_p122_fig_423.jpg" width="600" height="414" alt="" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>The steam cylinders and pump are self-contained, and
aside from the distinctive difference in the reciprocating gear
the design of the steam and water ends does not differ from
the vertical engines of the Clapp &amp; Jones type.</p>

<p>On these engines intended for use in cold climates <em>a “thaw-pipe”
is attached</em>, at the engineer’s side, inside the frame, and
is used in extremely cold weather to prevent the feed-pump, as
well as the main pump and connecting pipes, from freezing. It
is operated by means of a small globe valve. If it is desired
to warm the main pump, the two-way cock used in feeding the
boiler should be turned as when feeding directly from the main
pump, when steam will have access both to the main pump
and the feed-pump; but care must be observed not to heat the
main pump too warm. When the two-way cock is closed, and
also when it is open as when feeding from the tank, the steam
goes only to the feed-pump.</p>

<p>After using it to warm the main pump, the two-way cock,
should be closed; otherwise, if the check-valve should happen to stick
fast, the water would pass out of the boiler through the main pump.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 424.</span></p></div>

<p><em>Always keep the globe valve closed when not in use.</em> It will be
observed that the vacuum chamber upon the suction pipe is located
within the air chamber upon the discharge passage.</p>

<p>The valves of this pump are formed by heavy rubber rings which
surround the pump barrel, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_423">423</a>, therefore there can be
no hammering of these valves when the pump is at work.</p>

<p>The rubber rings have slots cut into them at each side of each valve
so that each valve can open and close without stretching the rubber
bands. The steam valve is of the well-known rocker type. The plungers
have no packing excepting water.</p>

<p><em>The Ahrens steam fire engine</em> is not presented as a whole,

<p>The boiler, Fig. <a href="#fig_426">426</a>, is radically different from others, and
the special features making it so popular in the past are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
absence of a crown sheet and smoke flues, coupled with the
advantageous manner in which the water-tube coil sections can
be withdrawn from the containing shell of the boiler. The
peculiar arrangement of the tubes compels a forced circulation
of the water, and for which purpose an independent steam
pump is provided. Water drawn from the fire-box leg is forced
through the water tubes, and this relation between the circulating
pump and the other elements of the boiler will be more
readily understood by reference to the illustrations, where Fig.

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.</h3></div>

<p><em>The fire engine is essentially an apparatus adapted to
emergencies</em>, and owing to the intermittent nature of the duty
performed, it is quite likely, unless the proper precautions are
observed, that its several parts, more especially its interior
mechanism, will suffer more deterioration while standing idle than from
actual service.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is necessary that these interior parts, as well as those more readily
apparent, be cared for with a view of keeping them constantly in condition
to endure the most severe and protracted strains at the shortest notice.
While standing in the house, the engine should at all times be kept ready
for immediate service, with shavings and kindlings in the fire-box, and as
much kindlings and coal in the fuel pan as can be conveniently carried.</p>

<p>In winter, if no heater is attached to the engine, the room must be kept
warm, to insure against frost.</p>

<p>The machine should be started gradually, but before doing so the engineer
ought to satisfy himself that the joints and connections in the suction
hose are air tight, that the discharge gate is open, the churn valve closed,
that the fire has been properly attended to, the cylinder cocks open, the exhaust
nearly closed, and all the bearings and journals well oiled, and the
wheels properly blocked, especially if the engine is standing on a grade.</p>

<p>The automatic air cocks on the upper pump heads must be opened immediately
after starting. They serve to promptly relieve the upper pump
discharge chambers of air, and may be closed as soon as water escapes from
their orifices.</p>

<p>When cylinder condensation has nearly ceased, the engine being warm,
the drain cocks should be closed and the machine speeded up gradually
until a good pressure of steam is obtained.</p>

<p>Until the engineer has had some experience with the machine, and is
familiar with its workings, it is not advisable to use more than 90 or 100
pounds of steam, which is all that is required for ordinary fire duty; the
necessity for more than 120 pounds will probably never arise.</p>

<p>The stuffing-boxes of the engine and pump should be carefully packed.</p>

<p>All of the bearings and journals, as well as the oil cans, should be well
supplied with good oil. The best mineral engine oil is recommended for
this purpose, as it does not gum or change its viscosity with variations in
the temperature of the atmosphere, and it will endure a higher temperature
than animal or fish oil without injury.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_430">
<img src="images/i_p130.jpg" width="600" height="335" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 430.</span>—See page <a href="#Page_141">141</a>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The engineer should keep all joints tight, the stuffing-boxes properly
packed, and all bearings thoroughly oiled.</p>

<p>If the journal boxes or other working parts require taking up, remember
that a little play is preferable to a close adjustment liable to cripple the engine
at a critical moment. To insure perfect safety, always thoroughly test
the apparatus after making such repairs, by subjecting the parts affected,
to the strains usually encountered in actual service.</p>

<p>The principal requirement of the steam cylinders and slide valves is
proper and constant lubrication. Let this one item be attended to, and
its mechanism will practically take care of itself for many years.</p>

<p>The joints and connections in the suction must be perfectly tight.</p>

<p>Before laying the fire, see that the grate and fire-box are clean, also that
the grate bars are fast, so they will not be liable to jar out, and that all the
steam outlets of the boiler are tightly closed.</p>

<p>Lay on the grate some dry pine shavings—not too many—spread evenly
over the grate, with a few hanging down between the bars; on the shavings
put some finely-split pine or hemlock wood, then some a little coarser, and
finally a quantity coarser still. It is well to put on the top some finely-split
hard wood. These kindlings must all be dry and split—not sawed—and
should be put in loosely, in layers, the layers being crossed, so that there
will be a free circulation of air between them.</p>

<p>To light the fire: Apply torch (described in page 135) <em>below the grate</em>,
never in the door; and while doing so move the torch around to insure
thoroughly igniting the shavings.</p>

<p>When there is a pressure of 40 to 60 pounds of steam, begin throwing in
coal, a little at a time, broken up in pieces about the size of a man’s fist.
Bituminous coal should be used, the same as that from which illuminating
gas is made. It should be of the very best quality, and very free burning.</p>

<p>Do not put the wood or coal all close to the fire door, but scatter it about
and spread it evenly over the grate.</p>

<p>As soon as the engine is started, coal should be put on often, a little at a
time, and the grate should be kept covered, but not thickly—say to a depth
of three or four inches. Be particular to fire evenly and regularly, <em>taking
care to cover air holes through the fire</em>, and to keep the fire door closed as
much as possible.</p>

<p>The grate bars should be kept well raked out from below, and the fire
and coal occasionally stirred off the grate bars inside the fire-box, using the
flat side of the poker for the latter operation.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The water in the boiler should be carried as high as six or eight inches
in the glass tube as soon as the engine gets fairly to work and a good pressure
of steam is raised. The gauges will indicate more water in the boiler
when the machine is running than it will with the same quantity of water if
it is not at work, owing to the expansion of water by the application of heat.</p>

<p>If there is a tendency to foam, the feed should be increased and the surface
blow-off opened quite frequently to relieve the boiler of the scum and
surplus water. If the foaming is unusually violent, it may be subdued by
stopping the engine for a few moments and permitting the water to settle.</p>

<p>During temporary stops the fire should be cleaned, by removing the
clinkers and the moving parts of the machinery examined and oiled.</p>

<p>The boiler is usually fed by force pumps, the plungers of which are secured
directly to the yokes of the main engines. Both pumps are arranged
to work in unison; and the supply is generally taken from the discharging
chamber of the main pumps, and is controlled by an ordinary globe valve.
Should the water being delivered by the main pumps be unsuitable for feeding
the boiler, this valve must remain closed, and a supply from a barrel or
tank introduced through the connection provided for that purpose.</p>

<p>When feeding the boiler, it is a good plan to occasionally feel the pipe
leading from check to boiler with the hand, as one can tell by this means
whether the pump is feeding properly. If feeding all right, the pipe will be
cool. If the pipe is hot, the pump is not feeding properly, try the pet cock.</p>

<p>Always keep a good torch, ready for use, in the fuel pan. This can be
made by tying some cotton waste on one end of a stick about two feet long
and saturating the waste with kerosene oil.</p>

<p>The kindling should be carefully prepared, and the quantity carried sufficient
to generate a working pressure in the boiler before coal is added to
the fire.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to use too large nozzles if two or more streams
are being thrown.</p>

<p>Owing to the contracted diameter of fire hose, the flow of the water is
retarded; the loss of power due to friction increases directly with the length
of the line and nearly as the square of velocity. In other words, if the loss
due to a given flow be 12 pounds for 100 feet of hose, then 24 pounds will
be required to maintain the same rate through an additional 100 feet. To
double the velocity will require four times the pressure, or 48 pounds for
100 feet and 96 pounds for 200 feet.</p>

<p>From this brief explanation, it must be plain that the capacity of any
engine is diminished as the length of the line of hose is increased.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For this reason, the greater the lift the smaller the stream that can be
thrown effectively, and the size of nozzle used should depend upon the
height the water is draughted, reducing it one-eighth inch for every five
feet above a lift of ten feet. If the engine uses a 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch nozzle for ordinary
work, it will answer for any lift up to 10 feet. If water has to be draughted
15 feet, a 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch nozzle should be used; if 20 feet, 1-inch; and if 25 feet,
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch.</p>

<p>Never start a fire unless one full gauge cock of water appears in the boiler.</p>

<p>The suction basket or strainer should always be attached when draughting
water, and every precaution taken <em>to insure tight connections in the
suction</em>. The basket must be kept well under the surface, to avoid clogging
if the water be foul.</p>

<p>When the supply is taken from a hydrant, the valve should be fully
turned on; if opened before water is wanted through the hose the discharge
gates on the pumps must be closed. Unless the pressure is excessive, the
hydrant is usually permitted to remain open while the steamer is attached,
the discharge during temporary stops being controlled by the pump gates.</p>

<p><em>The apparatus should always be halted, or placed at a proper point, with
reference to the source of the water supply.</em> When attached to a hydrant or
plug, do not run the engine faster than the water will flow to supply the
pump, and if the supply is not sufficient to allow the pump to work to its
full capacity, avoid using too large nozzles.</p>

<p>The safety of life and property is very often dependent upon the skill
and good judgment of the engineer, and as the maximum effect of such apparatus
is generally required at the most critical time and under the most
exciting circumstances, it is important that the endeavor by constant and
persistent practice to acquire that confidence and proficiency that will insure
a correct and decisive action in all matters pertaining to the management of
the machine.</p>

<p>From three-fourths to one inch of water should be indicated in the glass
gauge, except when there is a heater attached to the engine, then from four
to five inches should be carried. The bottom of the glass tube being on a
line with the crown-sheet, when one inch of water shows in the tube, the
water-line in the boiler is then one inch above the crown-sheet.</p>

<p>It is advisable occasionally—say once a month—in towns where fires are
not frequent, to fire up and take the engine out for practice and drill, and to
make sure that it is in proper working order, after which the boiler should
be blown off and refilled with fresh water, as hereinafter directed.</p>

<p>Every engine required to pump salt water, or other water unfit for the
boiler supply, should be provided with a fresh-water feed tank.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><em>The purpose of the automatic air cock</em> (if there is one) is to prevent the
rattling of the check valves when the pumps are being only partially filled;
if the supply is to be drawn from a barrel or tank, the entrance of air
through this cock must be prevented.</p>

<p><em>When draughting the water, bear in mind that the greater the perpendicular
lift the less the quantity of water which can be pumped</em>, remembering
that it is the pressure of the atmosphere which forces the water into the
pump, and not any power exerted by the pump itself, which simply produces
the vacuum. Thus, the nearer the surface of the water the greater the
velocity with which it enters the pump, while the higher the pump the
weaker the pressure and the less the quantity of water which enters it, and
at a height of about 30 feet no water at all will go into the pump.</p>

<p>If it is suspected that one of the joints in the suction is loose, the speed
of the engine may be slackened without stopping entirely, until water is
thrown eight or ten feet from the nozzle, when if the pump is taking air the
stream will snap and crack instead of flowing out smoothly. If it is found
that the pump is taking air through the suction, and the leak cannot be
located in any other way, it may be found by removing the suction basket
and turning the end of the suction up higher than the top of the pump, and
then filling it with water. The water will be forced out through the joints
wherever loose, and leaks can be found in this way.</p>

<p>The principal object of <em>the churn valve</em> is to permit the operation of the
pumps without discharging any water through the natural channels; it controls
a passage by which the discharging side of the pumps is connected
with the suction chamber. In draughting water, when the pumps are first
started, <em>this valve must remain closed</em> until the pumps are filled with water,
thereby excluding the air which would find its way into the suction chamber
if the same were open. It should also be closed when the pumps are at rest,
to prevent the dropping of the water into the suction pipe.</p>

<p>When the engine is put to suction, acquire the habit of feeling this valve
to assure its complete closure.</p>

<p>If there is anything about the engine that is not fully understood, or if it
fails to do its work properly from any cause, the maker should be communicated
with at once; inquiries are promptly answered, and usually required
information or suggestions are cheerfully furnished.</p></div>

<h3>THE AMERICAN STEAM FIRE ENGINE.</h3></div>

<p><em>The number of appliances and special devices</em> used on and
about a steam fire engine is not large, as it is the aim of both
designers and builders to simplify the machine as much as possible
without diminishing its efficiency.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#figs_434_435">434</a> is an appliance known as the <em>Siamese connection</em>.
It is used for stand pipes attached to the outside of buildings,
etc., and also as a detail of the fire pump. Its use is to lead
off two lines of hose.</p>

<p>The valve shown in the figure, closes automatically in case
of stoppage of one of the engines or the bursting of the hose.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#figs_434_435">435</a> exhibits an approved form of <em>strainer</em> for the
bottom of the suction pipe.</p>

<p><em>The American steam fire engine pump</em> is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_431">431</a>
and <a href="#fig_432">432</a>.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_431">431</a> being the front view, one side of it shown in
section, exposing the interior parts for explanation, and Fig.
<a href="#fig_432">432</a>, representing the side elevation, also in section.</p>

<p>The pumps, which are double acting, are united in a gun-metal
casting, which forms a single body for both, and permits
them to be placed much closer as to centers than could otherwise
be done. This method provides an ample suction-chamber
which is common to both.</p>

<p>In cross section the pump somewhat resembles a box girder.
This peculiarity of the pump’s combined form furnishes a rigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
base for the entire structure, simplifies the driving mechanism
and enables it to endure extraordinary strains without vibration.</p>

<p>It will be seen by reference to the cuts that any of the
valves can be easily and quickly examined, and, if necessary,
replaced, by simply removing the caps and heads.</p>

<p>The pump barrels are provided with removable linings,
which can readily be replaced with new ones in case the same
should become worn after years of service. These, as well as
the valve seats, are made of gun metal, no cast iron or other
material subject to corrosion by water being used in any part
of the pumps.</p>

<p>Both the suction and discharge valves are supplied with improved
valve springs, the tension of which is, at all times, the
same; and being made of phosphor bronze, the springs retain
their elasticity and will not corrode.</p>

<p>The steam cylinders used in connection with this pump are
of the ordinary slide-valve type, with which most mechanics
are familiar, and are thus easily repaired when necessary. The
cylinders and pumps are detached from the boiler, and are
separated therefrom sufficiently to allow every facility for getting
at each and every part. All connections, both steam and
water, are made outside of the boiler.</p>

<p><em>The La France steam fire engine pump</em> is shown in outline
in Fig. <a href="#fig_433">433</a>, which consists of a double plain slide-valve engine,
operating a double pump.</p>

<p>The steam piston rod of each side connects with its pump
rod, by means of square bars, two of which are on each side of
the crank shaft. The crank is operated by the cross-head
through a connecting rod; the arrangement of these parts can
be seen in Fig. <a href="#fig_433">433</a>. The cross-head guide is entirely done
away with, as the stiffness of the connection between the two
piston rods takes the thrust of the connecting rod.</p>

<p>The pump barrel is enclosed by an outer casing. The space
between barrel and casing is always kept filled with water
which is supplied through the suction pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_436">
<img src="images/i_p140.jpg" width="600" height="364" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 436.</span></p></div>

<p>When the pump barrel is being filled with water the suction
valves are lifted from their seats, which allows the water to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
pass into the space between the valve-seat plates and thence
into the pump barrel.</p>

<p>When the pump barrel is being emptied the suction valves
are closed while the discharge valves are open, which allows the
water to pass into a triangular shaped space between the front
plate and valve-seat plates thence upward to the discharge pipe.</p>

<p>The suction and discharge valve of this pump being all
grouped together, it is only necessary to remove the plates
which can be seen, Fig. <a href="#fig_433">433</a>, bolted to the front of the pumps
and form part of the outer casing; these plates are in front of
the pump and may be quickly unscrewed by a <span class="sans"><b>T</b></span> wrench.</p>

<p><em>The Amoskeag steam fire engine</em> is shown in the views (Figs.
<a href="#fig_429">429</a> and <a href="#fig_430">430</a> on pages 128 and 130). This world widely known
machine is made by the Manchester Locomotive Works at
Manchester, New Hampshire, U. S. A.</p>

<p>The former cut represents the extra first, first, second, third
and fourth size double steam fire engine of this make. They
have “crane-neck” frames and are arranged for horse draft and
are mounted upon Endicott’s patent platform springs. The
effect of this improvement is that the draft strain is transmitted
directly from the horses to the axles, the springs bearing no
part of this draft strain.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_430">430</a> shows the “fifth” size, also with “crane-necked”
frame and made for either horse or hand draft.</p>

<p>The boiler used is upright and tubular in style, is made of
the best quality of steel plate, with seamless copper tubes,
thoroughly riveted and stayed; it is simple in its construction,
and for strength, durability, accessibility for repairs, and its
capacity for generating steam, has passed a most critical test.
For engines of the second size and larger, the boilers expand
downwards at the crown sheet of the fire-box, thus increasing
the grate surface and consequently the steaming capacity of
the boiler.</p>

<p>The connections with the steam cylinders are simple, direct
and of good capacity, peculiarly accessible for repairs, and have
<em>the great advantage of being entirely unexposed to the air</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>The steam cylinders of the single engines are made in one
casting; they are secured to the boiler framing, and covered
with a lagging of wood, with a metallic jacket on the outside.
The pump for the double engines is made entirely of composition,
and its main shell is also in one casting. It is vertical
double acting; its valves are vertical in their action; the water-ways
are free and direct, and the valves accessible, so that
examination or renewal of these parts may be quickly made.
The pump is arranged for receiving suction hose on either side,
and has outlets also on either side for receiving the leading
hose.</p>

<p><em>Self-propelled steam fire engines</em> are well adapted for city
service. In Fig. <a href="#fig_436">436</a> is shown a double extra, first size self-propelling
engine of the Amoskeag pattern. The road driving
power is applied from one end of the main crank shaft, through
an equalizing compound and two endless chains running over
sprocket-wheels on each of the main rear wheels, permitting
these rear wheels to be driven at varying speeds as when turning
corners.</p>

<p>The driving power is made reversible, so that the engine
may be driven either forward or backward on the road at will.</p>

<p>The steering of the engine is effected by means of a steering
hand wheel at the front, adjusting the front axle through
a system of bevel and worm gearing, so arranged that the constant
exertion of the steersman is not required to keep the
wheels in line on the road. By the removal of a key the driving
power may be disconnected from the road driving gearing,
when it is desired to work the pumps when the engine is standing
still.</p>

<h3 id="MINING_PUMPS">MINING PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p>There are certain well-known difficulties and contingencies
in installing and operating mine pumps: 1, The location of the
mine is usually remote from supplies and any renewals or repairs
which may be needed, are liable
to be attended with excessive costs and
delays; 2, The nature of the water in
the mines is so highly acidulous that
corrosion takes place in an incredibly
small space of time. The action of
sulphuric (diluted) acid which is found
sometimes as high as two parts out of
a hundred begins at once and continues
until the iron or steel is destroyed; 3,
The dust, grit, mud, etc., becomes mixed
with the oil used to lubricate the pump;
these ingredients find their way into
the stuffing-boxes and cut the plungers.</p>

<p>Hence, ample and unusual precautions
are made to overcome the foregoing
conditions. Extreme care has to
be used in securing all movable parts
of the machine and the connecting
pipes. The plungers are generally outside
packed and handholes are arranged
to permit free access to the water valves.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_438">

<p>When pumps used in mining service assume large proportions,
they are almost invariably described as pumping engines;
there is no real difference between the two except the
proportions. The same combination of engine and pump in the
smaller sizes used for boiler feeding, etc., are called steam pumps.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The cost of repairing <em>a half-inch globe valve</em> which “gave out”
in a mine in Venezuela, South America, was represented in a $45. machine
charge and a mule ride of 35 miles to the shop containing a foot lathe and
the same distance back to the mines. The cost in a more favorable location
would be less than a dollar.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p><em>The Cataract steam pump</em>, Fig. <a href="#fig_437">437</a>, is largely used in mining
operations. Many years service has proved its peculiar and
curious merits. Large columns of water may be raised to great
elevation or forced against heavy pressures without shock or jar
of any kind and with safety to the machinery and connections;
abrupt and violent action of the water is also avoided. <em>The
Cataract</em>, it may be explained, is a regulator invented by
Smeaton for single-acting steam engines. John Smeaton, the
inventor, was an English civil engineer born in 1724 and died
in 1792. The device derives its name from its similarity to the
optical disease—a cataract—as it is a supplementary or sliding
cylinder with its piston attached very curiously <em>to the main
valve stem of the engine</em>.</p>

<p>This cylinder—called the Cataract cylinder—<em>is filled with
oil</em> which flows back and forth through a port connecting its
two ends. This port is controlled by a valve which increases
and diminishes the flow of the oil through the port. By means
of the Cataract, the movements of the main steam valve are
automatically graduated and controlled, so the speed of the
piston is reduced as it nears the end of its stroke, allowing the
valves to seat themselves gently and quietly, and the moving
column of water to come to a gradual and easy rest.</p>

<p>The claims of this construction of pumps have been thus
summarized—</p>

<p>1st. <em>The speed of the piston is automatically slowed down
at the end of its stroke</em>, giving time for the column of water to
come gradually to rest, and for the valves to seat gently and
quietly, avoiding all concussion, jar, or the slightest tremor.</p>

<p>2d. <em>The speed of the engine can be adjusted and automatically
maintained as desired under any pressure.</em> Should it be
working under full head of steam and against a heavy pressure,
and the pressure be instantly removed the speed would continue
unchanged.</p>

<p>3d. <em>The piston works to the end of its stroke under all pressures</em>,
avoiding the waste of steam incident to the piston falling
short of its stroke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>It will be understood that there is only a slight waste of oil
caused by the use of this apparatus—all the waste that there
is, being the small amount leaking through the stuffing boxes.</p>

<p>The term “Isochronal,” pump meaning equal spaces in
equal times has been applied to both these pumps and their
valve gear.</p>

<p>The sizes, capacities, etc., of the pump described on the
opposite page are given in the following</p>

<p>The above table is based on a steam pressure of 45 to 50
pounds per square inch of steam piston, and the vertical height
is from lower end of suction pipe to discharge.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_438">438</a> is designed to show a pump largely used by miners
in prospecting. It is double levered so that four men or more
can operate it, two to each lever. The plunger and valves are
so designed that they will lift muddy or gritty water without
injury to these parts.</p>

<p>An electric mining pump is shown on page 276, part one.
This is a portable pump mounted on a car running on rails and
is designed for the work appertaining to a mine in steady
operation.</p>

<p>On page 340, part one, is illustrated a powerful pump with
four outside packed plungers designed for mining purposes.</p>

<h3>SINKING PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p>These special mining pumps are used to drain water from the shaft
bottom, so that work in deepening or repairing may be carried on. As
shown in the illustration they are made to be suspended by a chain or
bail attached to eye-bolts in the upper cylinder head at points of
support which will enable the pump to hang vertically and be raised and
lowered at will.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_439">
<img src="images/i_p148.jpg" width="170" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 439.</span></p></div>

<p>The bail is so constructed that while the pump is suspended the
cylinder head can, if necessary on the smaller sizes, be removed and
the steam piston examined and adjusted. As the shaft gets deeper the
chain may be lengthened out and an extra joint placed on the end of the
delivery pipe.</p>

<p>The sinking pump is subjected to the hardest usage of any, hence any
steam pump that is to be used in sinking a mine shaft must be strong,
certain in operation, capable of handling gritty water and require
little attention.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_438">438</a> exhibits <em>a hand-power mining pump</em>, designed especially
for prospecting, etc., and made by the Edson Manufacturing Co., Boston,
Mass. It is listed for three sizes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>No. 6, capacity 1200 gallons per hour, 1 man.</p>

<p>No. 8, capacity 4000 gallons per hour, 2 men.</p>

<p>No. 10, capacity 6000 gallons per hour, 2 men.</p></div>

<p><em>The outfit</em> which usually goes with this diaphragm lift and
force pump includes special suction and conducting hose, brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
coupling and strainer; these pumps will raise and force water
containing gravel, sand, dirt or tailings without choking.</p>

<p><em>The Deane single vertical sinking pump</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_439">439</a>;
a table of dimensions and capacities of this pump is also given
below.</p>

<p>The pump illustrated is double acting and of the differential
plunger type; the water end is in three parts and consists of a
water cylinder, a lower plunger and an upper plunger. The
water passes directly up and through the plungers, both of
which are hollow. These plungers are outside packed. The
water valves are reached by hand holes provided for that purpose.
Split pins are used in the ends of the bolts to prevent
the nuts from working off.</p>

<p>These pumps are designed to stand a working pressure of
150 lbs. to the square inch. They have the regular Deane
valve motion and will work under water.</p>

<p>This is one of the most successful mine sinking pumps designed;
there are no parts exposed to rust, and instances have
occurred when this pump has started off and cleared a shaft of
water when the pump itself had been buried for weeks under a
mass of fallen rock and debris.</p>

<p>This pump has no outside valve gear, arms or levers; all movable
parts are inside and enclosed, to prevent collision with the walls
of the mine shaft nor is it likely to receive injury from blast
explosions. Being fitted with special exhaust cut-off, it will
continue to run as fast as steam will drive it (with an irregular or
intermittent supply of water, or when the water fails entirely,) not
only without danger of the piston striking the heads, but without
injury to the valves. It is designed and intended to handle gritty
water.</p>

<p><em>Telescopic pipe joint</em> shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_442">442</a> and <a href="#fig_443">443</a>, supplies a
convenient means for lifting and lowering a sinking pump, and is
usually made in lengths of sixteen feet. This enables the operator to
drop the pump that distance without disturbing the rest of the pipe; by
its use irregular lengths of pipe can be added, whereas, otherwise when
the pump is lowered the pipe would have to be cut of equal length.</p>

<p>The inside pipe is brass tubing which freely slips through
the packing and is non-corrosive.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_441">441</a> exhibits the sinking pump in practical operation;
it is the same as that shown on the previous page.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Mining pumps require to be made “to gauge” and interchangeable;
an advantage which commends itself to experienced mining engineers.
Many “parts” should be provided in duplicate on account of the
rough usage and hard service alluded to above.</p></div>

<p><em>The “Scranton” pattern of a mining pump</em> is illustrated by

<p>The plungers of this machine work through middle, exterior
stuffing-boxes, into four separate and distinct water cylinders.
The valve areas and water ways are unusually large in proportion
to the displacement of the plunger, so that the velocity
and consequent destructive action of the water currents is
decreased in passing through the pump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>These pumps are designed to withstand safely a working
pressure of 250 pounds to the square inch, and all their attachments
are especially strengthened with a view to meeting the
rough usage and hard work to which they are liable to be subjected
in mining operations.</p>

<p><em>The Worthington Pressure Pump.</em> This pump, presented in
Fig. <a href="#fig_446">446</a>, is specially designed for use in connection with hydraulic
lifts and cranes, cotton presses, testing machines,
hydraulic riveting and punching machines and hydraulic presses
of all kinds. Also, for oil-pipe lines, mining purposes and services
requiring the delivery of liquids under heavy pressures.</p>

<p>There are four, single-acting, outside-packed plungers, which
work through the ends of the water cylinders, the latter having
central partitions. The arrangement of compound steam cylinders
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_445">445</a>, or a triple expansion arrangement,
can be applied to these pumps where a saving of fuel is
desired. The water valves are easily accessible and are contained
in small independent chambers, capable of resisting
very heavy pressure.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="MARINE_PUMPS">MARINE PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p>These are made both horizontal and vertical; the prime
consideration being in all cases the amount of floor space the
pump will require. This is especially true in reference to small
steam vessels, pleasure craft, etc.</p>

<p>Owing to the unusual corrosion, caused by galvanic action,
salt and various impurities, marine pumps are built of iron with
brass linings, but frequently with the entire water ends of
bronze.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the water valves in the most approved
forms of vertical pumps is such that the pistons are always
submerged, and the water valves sealed, thereby securing immediate
lift of water through the suction pipe, and steady, quiet
operation of the pump; many horizontal pumps of the ordinary
duplex design are also used on shipboard.</p>

<p><em>The ship’s pump</em> is common to all vessels and used to keep
the “hold” free from water. It is usually worked by hand but
it is the law in certain countries that the “ship’s pump,” aside
from steam vessels—shall be driven by windmill power; it is
said to be an odd sight to see the practical working of these at
sea.</p>

<p>The capacity for boiler feeding in the table is based upon
sixty single strokes for each pump per minute.</p>

<h3>THE “WRECKING” PUMP.</h3></div>

<p><em>The Worthington wrecking pump</em>, Fig. <a href="#fig_448">448</a>, was constructed
many years ago, for wrecking, drainage, or irrigating purposes,
and has proved itself to be remarkably well adapted to such
service. It is used generally by the Wrecking Companies on the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the lakes, and is constructed with
special reference to reliability, portability and general efficiency.</p>

<p>It is also well adapted for other services requiring the delivery
of large quantities of water within the range of lift by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
suction. It has no forcing power, the water being delivered
over the top of the pump into the curb surrounding it. It is
single-acting, although the discharge is practically constant, by
reason of the quick return of the piston to the bottom of the
cylinder, during which inactive stroke the water continues to
flow by the momentum already acquired, thus the effect of a
double-acting pump is almost produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_448">
<img src="images/i_p158.jpg" width="407" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 448.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>The ordinary slide valve is employed, moved by an arm
striking against tappets on the valve rod. No auxiliary valves
are used in connection with it. The water valves are of rubber,
the lower ones being upon a permanent plate at the bottom of
the pump. The plunger also is covered with valves. These
last open for the passage of water when the piston descends.</p>

<p>On account of its short stroke and large diameter, this
pump is extremely efficient, running on comparatively low
pressure of steam, and with a very small percentage of loss
from friction or leakage. It is also simple and durable, with
few parts.</p>

<p>The stated capacities of the pumps given in the table can
be exceeded in cases of emergency.</p>

<h3>THE “BALLAST” PUMP.</h3></div>

<p>This machine is constructed to meet the requirements of
steamship builders and is recognized and adopted by marine
engineers of this and of other countries as the standard design
for this service and <em>for oil tank steamer work</em>.</p>

<p>It will be observed, see Fig. <a href="#fig_449">449</a>, that its proportions are
such as to secure the advantages of large pumping capacity
with unusual compactness and moderate weight.</p>

<p>This pump is of the packed piston type, and has the valves
so arranged that the water pistons are always submerged, thus
making it particularly well adapted for long and difficult suction
lifts such as are met with in steamers carrying petroleum in
bulk, and in steamers having extensive systems of water ballast
tanks.</p>

<p>The purposes for which pumps are used on shipboard, aside
from the air and circulating pumps for condensers, are:</p>

<p>(1.) Feeding the boiler.</p>

sure of an ample supply of feed water one of the other
pumps is made strong enough to serve the same purpose, or
sometimes an injector is fitted as an auxiliary feeding mechanism.</p>

<p>A bilge pump has special fittings, for the reason that it
handles very dirty water, undesirable to be transmitted through
any other pipe system. In small ships, however, one pump,
the so-called “donkey,” often serves for nearly all other purposes,
including auxiliary boiler feeding.</p>

<p>A special form of pump in use on Western river steamers is
the so-called “doctor,” an independent pump with a walking
beam, by which one steam cylinder drives a system of pumps
for feed, fire and bilge pumping purposes (Fig. <a href="#fig_450">450</a>).</p>

<p>The feed pump should be of simple construction, great
strength and ample capacity, to secure great regularity and
reliability of service under the severe conditions of high pressure.</p>

<p>The main parts of auxiliary feed pumps are often duplicated.
This is a desirable point, as one set of spare parts in
piston, rings, valves, etc., is suitable for both pumps.</p>

<p>The main feed pump is, even in the independent type, often
placed in the engine room, while the auxiliary pump, or the
injector, is in the fire room. The feed pumps draw usually
from the hot well, feed heater and feed tanks and discharge
through main feed pipe into the boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p><em>This “doctor” pump</em> is a substantial piece of mechanism. The
bases of columns and pump chamber flanges are accurately
planed, the cylinder has spring piston packing and the plain
slide valve is made of gun metal.</p>

<p>The hot water pumps, 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>″ diam. &times; 10″ stroke, have chambers
bored and are fitted with a copper and tin composition for
valves and scats; the latter are driven into their places and
riveted over underneath.</p>

<h3>HYDRAULIC GAUGE TEST PUMP.</h3></div>

<p>These gauges are apt to get out of order for various reasons
namely, there is no theoretical method of determining the
motion of the pointer due to a given pressure; this is done
by tests in which known pressures are employed, and accordingly
the divisions on the graduated scale are usually unequal,
hence these instruments are tested by attaching them either to
a mercury column, or to a dead weight safety valve having for
its seat an exact square inch surrounded by a knife edge, or a
piston of standard area loaded with weights. This sharp edge
is covered by a fibre washer of leather for moderate pressures,
say 150 lbs. per square inch, or vulcanized
fibre or its equivalent for higher pressures.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_451">451</a> represents a pump that can be used for pressures
up to 10,000 lbs. per square inch. The Hand-Lever Pump
shown at the right in cut is used for filling the Pressure Pump
cylinder and connections with oil or glycerine, and may also
serve for testing gauges of low pressures up to 15 or 20 lbs.
The suction pipe <em>a</em> is connected with the reservoir containing
the oil or glycerine, which after being used is discharged by
valve <em>d</em> and returned into the reservoir by pipe <em>c</em>.</p>

<p>In filling the pump the cylinder spindle has to be screwed
all the way out, and the valves <em>b</em> and <em>d</em> closed before it is put
under pressure.</p>

<h3 id="SUGAR_HOUSE_PUMPS">“SUGAR-HOUSE” PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p>The handling of semi-liquids, commercially known as <em>thick
stuff</em>, has always been considered more or less of a serious
problem, and many designs of mechanism in the form of
pumps have been invented for that purpose.</p>

<p><em>For pumping tar the improved forms of rotary pumps</em> have
recently come largely into use. These will be described later
under their proper heads. Fig. 212, page 232, Part one, represents
a very satisfactory design of plunger pump for handling
the heavy stuff alluded to.</p>

<p><em>The Deane single sugar-house pump</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_452">452</a>.
These are largely used for pumping molasses, syrup, cane-juice,
melter-pan products, etc., and are fitted with linings, valves,
etc., to best suit the condition of the fluid to be pumped.</p>

<p>The valves are very large and the motion of the pumps is
somewhat slower than for water. By removing one set of
bolts all the valves are uncovered.</p>

<p>These products of the sugar-house when of a high temperature
can be pumped nearly as fast as water; the following list
gives the approved proportions of these pumps.</p>

<p><em>The Single Magma Pump.</em> The term <em>magma</em> includes any
crude mixture, especially of organic matters in the form of a
thin paste, it also means “a confection,” hence, the name given
to the pump illustrated in Figs. <a href="#fig_453">453</a> and <a href="#fig_454">454</a> is very appropriately
applied to a sugar-house apparatus. It is designed
for pumping various thick heavy mixtures and semi-liquids and
for moving massecuite, second and third sugar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_453">
<img src="images/i_p166_fig_453.jpg" width="600" height="194" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 454.</span></p></div>

<p>The construction in Fig. <a href="#fig_453">453</a> is such as to insure strength
and certainty of operation; there are no intricate small parts,
and the interior is readily accessible. These pumps are made
with brass-lined cylinders, or cylinders and fittings entirely of
composition when needed to overcome the difficulties appertaining
to pumping acidulous and corrosive liquid substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p><em>The single fly-wheel magma pump</em> as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_454">454</a> represents
the highest type of machine for this class of work.
The steam end is of the plain slide valve pattern. <em>It is fitted
with a heavy fly-wheel</em>, perfectly balanced. The admission of
steam is regulated by a throttling governor of approved design.
The fly-wheel and governor insure a uniform speed of the pump
under variations of load—hence the fly-wheel pump does not
require adjustment of throttle for every variation in water pressure,
as is necessary with direct acting pumps.</p>

<p>The following table applies to the two styles of the magma
pumps—with and without the fly-wheel, as the pump ends are
the same in both. Attention is called to the number of strokes
per minute (thirty) shown in the table as compared with the
number of strokes (100 and 125) called for in the previous table.
This is caused by the different viscosity of the stuff to be
handled by these machines.</p>

<p><em>The definition of the word circulation</em> conveys the best idea
of this mechanism—“The act of moving in a circle, or in a
course which brings the moving body to the place where its
motion began,” hence, a circulating pump is one which causes
the water to flow through a series of pipes or conduits, as for
example, the water in a steam boiler as in the Ahrens Fire
Engine, see page 126, Fig. <a href="#fig_426">426</a>, or in marine boilers, or forces
cooling water through a
surface condenser.</p>

<p>A centrifugal pump driven by an independent engine, see page 219,
Fig. <a href="#fig_497">497</a>, is generally used for the latter purpose.</p>

<p>The annexed engraving, Fig. <a href="#fig_454A">454A</a>, represents a circulating
pump attached to a salt water evaporator and distiller for recovering
fresh water at sea. The pump at the lower right-hand
corner of the engraving takes salt water through the suction at
the bottom and passes it upward through the condenser and
overboard through the circulation discharge. <em>Any steam pump
having a sufficient capacity may be used as a circulating pump.</em></p>

<p><em>The Bliss-Heath Atmospheric Pumping Engine</em> represented
by Fig. <a href="#fig_455">455</a> is novel in its construction, consisting of a low-pressure,
upright, tubular steam boiler, having a safety valve
loaded to carry 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> lbs. steam pressure. The large cover lifts
under 2 lbs. pressure, hence explosions cannot occur.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_455">

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The safety valve is shown on the floor alongside of the hand
bar arranged to work the feed pump. Fig. 455.</p></div>

<p>The motor is a simple atmospheric engine operating a
plunger pump and a single acting air pump.</p>

<p>The operation of this motor is almost noiseless.</p>

<p>The motive power is the normal pressure of the atmosphere
(14.7 lbs. to the square inch), utilized by the formation of a
vacuum in the power cylinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>The air is expelled from the cylinder by admitting steam
without appreciable pressure, <em>i.e.</em>, to balance that of the atmosphere,
after which the steam exhausts into the surface condenser,
in which a constant vacuum is maintained. Steam is
then admitted automatically into the power cylinder, breaking
the vacuum and imparting to the piston the required impetus.
<em>This principle is identical with that of the ordinary condensing
steam engine</em>, with the exception of the very low steam pressure
in this connection.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_456">
<img src="images/i_p170.jpg" width="339" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 456.</span></p></div>

<p>This engine can be operated satisfactorily in combination
with an ordinary house-heating boiler (low pressure), hence the
expense of running it is very low during the steam-heating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
season. During the summer months the boiler connected
with this engine can be used advantageously.</p>

<p>The bearings are self-oiling, and the cylinder condensation
furnishes ample protection for the inside of the engine cylinder.
There are no leather packings to burn out, and this is remarkably
free from the objections to the older types of caloric engines.</p>

<p>These pumps when required will force a proportionate
quantity of water to a greater height than fifty feet, upon
which the following table is based:</p>

<p>In pumping ammonia it is of the greatest importance that
this mechanism be simple and compact owing to the peculiar
properties—oftentimes dangerous—inherent to ammonia.</p>

<p>The plain slide valve with crank, shaft and fly-wheel probably
is less liable to give trouble than many of the other styles
of pumps, <em>and a full stroke is always assured</em>.</p>

<p>The pump here presented (Fig. <a href="#fig_456">456</a>) occupies little floor
space and is easily accessible; the bucket plunger is used and
also a slotted yoke in place of a connecting rod.</p>

<h3>THE WOOD PROPELLER PUMP.</h3></div>

<p>The pump shown herewith lifts the water by propeller
screws or “runners,” each consisting of two half-circular inclined
blades fastened to a shaft at intervals of 3 to 5 feet, and
of slightly less diameter than the casing, so as to revolve freely
within it.</p>

<p>Experiments have demonstrated that more water can be
raised with a given speed by putting the runners close together
near the bottom of the pump.</p>

<p>A bearing for the shaft is placed immediately underneath
each of the runners, and held in position by a set of spring
“guides” attached lengthwise to the well-casing. These
guides interrupt the whirling motion of the water as it is
thrown upward by the runners, and turns it back in the opposite
direction, thereby delivering it into the revolving runners
in a direction opposite their motion. By this method the
whirling motion of the water is utilized and the capacity
of the pump largely increased without a proportional increase
of power to run it.</p>

<p>With this pump, water may be raised from several hundred
feet below the surface by extending the shaft and runners
down the well-casing to the desired depth; it being always
necessary to submerge the lower runner. As the shaft rotates
the lower runner lifts the water up to the runner above it, and
so on to the next, until the water is delivered at or above the
ground if desired; the distance depending upon the size and
pitch of the runner, the number of runners, and the speed at
which they are driven.</p>

<p>Speed is not increased for additional depth, because more
runners are added, and this compounding of the runners increases
the efficiency of the pump.</p>

<p>A ball bearing is placed over the stuffing-box to carry the
entire weight of all the movable parts of the pump, and also the
column of water. In deep wells cone roller bearings are used
in place of the ball bearings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>The pumps are made to fit all sizes of wells and of any desired
capacity. Runners of various pitches are made for the
different sizes in order to suit the supply of water or the power
available. If, after testing, the supply of water in the well is
found to be limited, the runners are changed to raise the
amount of water due to a given horse-power, then runners
can be furnished with a pitch suited to lifting that particular
amount of water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_457">
<img src="images/i_p173.jpg" width="287" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 457.</span></p></div>

<p>For example, if one runner at a given speed, gives 10 pounds
pressure per square inch, then two runners would give 20<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
pounds; three, 30 pounds, and so on. For this reason water
may be elevated higher above the discharge with this pump
than with a centrifugal, for it would require a higher rate of
speed to lift a given amount of water 20 feet with one runner,
than to lift the same amount 5 feet. Hence the advantage of
compounding the runners as the lift is increased. The compounding
of runners is one of the main features of success and
efficiency of this pump.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_458">
<img src="images/i_p174.jpg" width="600" height="305" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 458.</span></p></div>

<p>Where the water is beyond the suction limit this pump can
be used to raise the water to the surface, discharging into the
suction of the force pump. In this manner, whatever surplus
of power the propeller pump might have in raising the water
to the surface, would be utilized in helping the water through
the force pump.</p>

<p>The speed of rotary pumps is generally high, ranging from
800 revolutions per minute for the small sizes to 250 revolutions
for the larger sizes. In a number of experiments made upon
this form of pump the highest efficiency was obtained with
pressures ranging from 30 to 50 pounds per square inch, and
speeds ranging from 475 to 575 revolutions per minute. The
average efficiency of the rotary pump is from 48 to 52 per cent.</p>

<h3 id="THE_SCREW_PUMP">THE SCREW PUMP.</h3></div>

<p>The engraving herewith, Fig. <a href="#fig_458">458</a>, exhibits the general construction
of the Quimby screw pump. The four screws that
act as pistons in propelling the water are mounted in pairs on
parallel shafts, and are so arranged that in each pair the thread
of one screw projects to the bottom of the space between the
threads of the opposite screws. The screw threads have flat
faces and peculiarly undercut sides; the width of the face and
the base of the thread being one-half the pitch. The pump
cylinder fits the perimeters of the threads. Space enough is
left between the screws and the cylinder and between the faces
of the intermeshing threads to allow a close running fit without
actual contact. There is no end thrust of the screws in their
bearings, because the back pressure of the column of liquid is
delivered through the suction, S, at the middle of the cylinder,
therefore the endwise pressure upon the screws in one direction
is exactly counterbalanced by a like pressure in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>The suction connection opens into a chamber underneath
the pump cylinder. The suction liquid passes through this
chamber to the two ends of the cylinder and is forced from the
ends toward the center by the action of the two pairs of intermeshing
threads; the discharge being in the middle of the top
of the cylinder, as shown at D. The power to drive the pump
is applied to one of the shafts, and the second shaft is driven
by means of a pair of gears, shown at G.</p>

<p>The pump has no internal packing, no valves and no small
moving parts. The only packing is in the stuffing-boxes where
the two shafts pass through the cylinder head.</p>

<p>Whether driven by a belt, an electric motor, or a steam engine,
the driving power is applied directly and without the loss
due to intermediate mechanism; as the screws are not in contact
with the cylinder or with each other, the consequent absence
of wearing surfaces gives the pump great durability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>These pumps have a high efficiency against a wide range of
pressures: The power being applied direct, the thrust due to
the back pressure of the column of liquid in the delivery pipe is
balanced.</p>

<p>As the action of the screws on the liquid is continuous, the
delivery is free from pulsation. By thus keeping the liquid in
constant and uniform motion the efficiency of the pump is increased
and the pump is made peculiarly suitable for certain
specific purposes as there is no churning effect upon the liquids
handled.</p>

<p>These pumps are much used in connection with hydraulic
elevators by pumping directly into the elevator cylinders, as
there is no pulsation. They are also used to pump oil into
pipe lines and are driven by electric motors as well as by belts.
For circulating pumps for brine and for fire purposes these
pumps have certain peculiar advantages.</p>

<h3>AERMOTOR PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p><em>Aer</em> is the first element in many compound words of Greek
origin meaning air, the air, atmosphere; in this connection it is
combined with <em>motor</em>, defined as a machine which transforms
the energy of water, steam, or electricity into mechanical
energy—in this instance, is meant the changing of <em>the power of
moving air or wind</em> into mechanical energy.</p>

<p><em>Wind is air put in motion.</em> There are two ways in which
the motion of the air may arise. It may be considered as an
absolute motion of the air, rarefied by heat and condensed by
cold; or it may be only an apparent motion, caused by the
superior velocity of the earth in its daily revolution.</p>

<p>When any portion of the atmosphere is heated it becomes
rarefied, its specific gravity is diminished, and it consequently
rises. The adjacent portions immediately rush into its place
to restore the equilibrium. This motion produces a current
which rushes into the rarefied spot from all directions. This is
what we call wind.</p>

<p><em>Meteorology</em> is the science which treats of the atmosphere
and its phenomena, particularly of its variations of heat and
cold, <em>of its winds</em>, etc.</p>

<p>This is the great division of science to which one has to turn
when searching for the first principles relating to the operation
of <em>aermotor pumps</em>. The vast volumes of air which flow “hither
and yon” are controlled by physical laws which act as accurately
and unceasingly as those which control and hold in check
the seemingly solid substance of the earth itself.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The portions north of the rarefied spot produce a north wind,
those to the south produce a south wind, while those to the east and west
in like manner, form currents moving in opposite directions. At the rare
spot, agitated as it is by winds from all directions, turbulent and boisterous
weather, whirlwinds, hurricanes, rain, thunder and lightning, prevail. This
kind of weather occurs most frequently in the torrid zone, where the heat is
greatest. The air, being more rarefied there than in any other part of the
globe, is lighter, and, consequently, ascends; that about the polar regions is
continually flowing from the poles towards the equator, to restore the
equilibrium; while the air rising from the equator flows in an upper current
towards the poles, so that the polar regions may not be exhausted.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up all observations, it can be said with truth that the
<em>sole force</em> immediately concerned in causing the movements of
the atmosphere, <em>is gravitation</em>.</p>

<p>So far as the prevailing winds are concerned it has been
shown that where pressure is high, that is to say, <em>where there
is a surplus of air, out of such a region winds blow in all
directions</em>; and, on the other hand where pressure is low, or
where there is a deficiency of air, <em>towards such a region</em>, winds
blow from all directions in an in-moving special course.</p>

<p>This outflow of air currents from a region of air pressure
upon a region of low pressure is reducible to a single principle,
as already stated, viz., the principle of gravitation.</p>

<p>A regular east wind prevails about the equator, caused in
part by the rarefaction of the air produced by the sun in his
daily course from east to west. This wind, combining with
that from the poles, causes a constant north-east wind for about
thirty degrees north of the equator, and a south-east wind at
the same distance south of the equator.</p>

<p>From what has now been said, it appears that there is a
circulation in the atmosphere; the air in the lower strata flowing
from the poles towards the equator, and in the upper strata
flowing back from the equator towards the poles. It may be
remarked, that the periodical winds are more regular at sea
than on the land; and the reason of this is, that the land reflects
into the atmosphere a much greater quantity of the sun’s
rays than the water, therefore that part of the atmosphere
which is over the land is more heated and rarefied than that
which is over the sea. This occasions the wind to set in upon
the land, as we find it regularly does on the coast of Guinea and
other countries in the torrid zone. There are certain winds,
called trade-winds, the theory of which may be easily explained
on the principle of rarefaction, affected, as it is, by the relative
position of the different parts of the earth with the sun at different
seasons of the year, and at various parts of the day.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the laws by which these winds are controlled
is of importance to the mariner. When the place of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
sun with respect to the different positions of the earth at the
different seasons of the year is understood, it will be seen that
they all depend upon the same principle. The reason that the
wind generally subsides at the going down of the sun is, that
the rarefaction of the air, in the particular spot which produces
the wind, diminishes as the sun declines, and, consequently, the
force of the wind abates.</p>

<p>From its importance in practical meteorology <em>Buys Ballot’s
law</em> may be stated in these two convenient forms. (1) Stand
with your back to the wind, and the center of the depression
or the place where the barometer is lowest will be to your left
in the northern hemisphere, and to your right in the southern
hemisphere. This is the rule for sailors by which they are
guided to steer with reference to storms. (2) Stand with the
high barometer to your right and the low barometer to your
left, and the wind will blow on your back, these positions in
the southern hemisphere being reversed. It is in this form that
the prevailing wind of any part of the globe may be worked
out from the charts.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>WIND POWER.</h3></div>

<p>It is as <em>a source of energy</em>, to be classified with heat, weight
of liquids, electricity, etc., that air in motion (as in a windmill)
has a place as a prime mover.</p>

<p><em>Prime movers</em>, or receivers of power, are those pieces or
combinations of pieces of mechanism which receive motion and
force directly from some natural source of energy. The point
where the mechanism belonging to the prime mover ends and
that belonging to the train for modifying the force and motion
begins may be held to include all pieces which regulate or assist
in regulating the transmission of energy from the source of
energy.</p>

<p><em>The useful work of the prime mover</em> is the energy exerted
by it upon that piece which it directly moves; and the ratio
which this bears to the energy exerted by the source of energy
is the efficiency of the prime mover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>In all prime movers the loss of energy may be divided
into two parts, one being the unavoidable effect of the circumstances
under which the machine necessarily works in the case
under consideration; the other the effect of causes which are,
or may be, capable of indefinite diminution by practical improvements.
Those two parts may be denominated as <em>necessary
loss and waste</em>.</p>

<p>The efficiency which a prime mover would have under given
circumstances if the waste of energy were altogether prevented,
and the loss reduced to necessary loss alone, is called <em>the maximum
or the theoretical efficiency</em> under the given circumstances.</p>

<p>In windmills, the air, being in motion, presses against, and
moves four or five radiating vanes or sails, whose surfaces are
approximately helical or screw shape, their axis of rotation being
parallel, or slightly inclined in a vertical plane, to the direction
of the wind.</p>

<p><em>The velocity of the wind determines its pressure</em>, and the
pressure of the wind against the sails of the windmill determines
the power developed by the mill. A mill of small diameter
acted upon by a high pressure develops as much power as a
large mill working under a lower pressure.</p>

<p><em>The mean average velocity of the wind for the entire United
States</em> is very nearly eight miles per hour. However, for large
areas such as the great plains east of the Rocky Mountains,
the mean average is about eleven miles per hour, and yet in
certain small areas situated in the mountainous districts the
mean average velocity is as low as five miles per hour. Therefore,
in selecting and loading a mill, reference should be had to
the wind velocity prevailing in that particular locality. In
general, windmills loaded to operate in ten-mile winds can be
depended upon to furnish a sufficient supply of water.</p>

<p>The variations in the velocity and pressure of the wind are
considerable even within a brief time, and sometimes sudden
and extreme. Winds of 100 miles per hour and upwards are on
record. A very violent gale in Scotland registered by an excellent
anemometer a pressure of 45 lbs. per square foot. During
the severe storm at London, the anemometer at Lloyd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>’s
registered a pressure of 35 lbs. to the square foot. The gauge
at Girard College, Philadelphia, broke under a strain of 42 lbs.
per square foot, a tornado passing at the moment within a
quarter of a mile. At the Central Park Observatory, a wind
was recorded of 28.5 lbs. pressure per square foot.</p>

<p>If the wind were to blow continuously a very small windmill
would suffice to do a large quantity of work and no storage
capacity would be required, but when it does blow it is “free”
and experience dictates that a mill shall be erected sufficiently
large to pump enough water, when the wind does blow, to last
over, with the assistance of ample storage capacity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Windmills are erected to be operated by the lightest winds. A
wind which will carry off smoke will move a windmill; and the absence of
a wind of this force means a perfect calm. Mr. Corcoran says: “My experience
of thirty years teaches that a calm has seldom, if ever, held sway
in this part of the world for a longer period than three days. Consequently,
with a tank to hold a three days’ supply, it becomes possible to pass over
any number of calms.”</p></div>

<h3 id="WIND_POWER_PUMPS">WIND POWER PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p>Windmills can be divided into two general classes according
to the inclination of the shaft: 1, <em>Horizontal mills</em>, in which
sails are so placed as to turn by the impulse of the wind in a
horizontal plane, and hence about an axis exactly vertical; and,
2, <em>vertical mills</em>, in which the sails turn in a nearly vertical
plane, <em>i.e.</em>, about an axis nearly horizontal.</p>

<p>On account of the many disadvantages connected with
the horizontal windmill, it is seldom brought into use, being
employed only in situations in which the
height of the vertical sails would be objectionable,
and this is liable to occur only in
extraordinary cases. In this kind of mill
six or more sails, consisting of plain boards,
are set upright upon horizontal arms resting
on a tower and attached to a vertical
axis, passing through the tower at its
middle part. If the sails are fixed in
position, they are set obliquely to the
direction in which the wind strikes them.
Outside of the whole is then placed
a screen or cylindrical arrangement of
boards intended to revolve, the boards
being set obliquely and in planes lying in
opposite courses to those of the sails. The
result is, from whatever direction the wind
may blow against the tower, it is always admitted by the outer
boards to act on the sails most freely in that half of the side it
strikes, or from which the sails are turning away, and it is
partly, though by no means entirely, broken from the sails
which in the other quadrant of the side are approaching the
middle line.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_461">
<img src="images/i_p185.jpg" width="200" height="479" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 461.</span></p></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The great objections to the horizontal windmill are: first, that
only one or two sails can be effectually acted upon at the same moment;
and, secondly, that the sails move in a medium of nearly the same density
as that by which they are impelled, and that great resistance is offered to
those sails which are approaching the middle. Hence with a like area of sails
the power of the horizontal is always much less than that of the vertical mill.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>The illustration on page 184, Fig. <a href="#fig_460">460</a>, is a representation of
the <em>Corcoran windmill</em>: it contrasts most interestingly with
the same apparatus shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_459">459</a>—a windmill of the early
part of the 17th century.</p>

<p>The figure below, <a href="#fig_462">462</a>, exhibits in detail <em>the rear view of the
Corcoran mill with the governor</em>. As the speed of the wheel
increases it swings the “tail” around, so as to bring the wheel
at an angle with the direction of the wind; the latter failing to
strike the blades squarely communicates less force, and in consequence
the speed is diminished; in case of a very high wind
the tail turns so as to present the wheel almost edgewise towards
the direction of the blast.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—A windmill of this type was erected at a station on the Long
Island R. R. to pump 5,000,000 gallons of water yearly. In order to test the
work of the windmill, a water meter was attached to the pump during six
months, and it was shown that the average work of the windmill had been
22,425 gallons per day, 4,260,750 gallons during the time stated and an average
rate of 8,000,000 gallons per year. The weight of water pumped was
16,168 tons gross and was raised to a height of 66 feet, and the work was
done without mishap with little attention given to the pumping machinery.</p></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 462.</span></p></div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_461">461</a> represents a Corcoran double action suction force
pump. The base is hollow and contains the suction and discharge
valves; a flange at the left-hand side receives the suction
pipe while a corresponding flange on the right-hand side connects
with the discharge pipe. An air chamber is attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the discharge end. The valves may be reached by removing
the bonnets on top of the base.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_463">
<img src="images/i_p187.jpg" width="292" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 463.</span></p></div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_463">463</a> is intended to represent an <em>Ideal steel tank tower</em>;
the tank is herein located near the top. A <em>force pump</em> is used
where water is delivered into an elevated tank as in this
case; a <em>lift pump</em> is employed to discharge water at the spout
and not to elevate above it.</p>

<p><em>The common term “Windmill pump” distinguishes a wind
power pump from a hand pump</em>, the difference being in an extension
of the piston rod above
the upper guide with a hole for
connection with the pump rod
from the windmill.</p>

<p>Such a pump, with the “pit-man”
extending from the pump
upwards into the tower, is shown
in Fig. <a href="#fig_465">465</a>. This figure is introduced
to show the tank connections
with a regulator on the
base of a four-post tower. The
float in the water tank throws the
mill in or out of gear according as
the water rises or falls in the tank.</p>

<p>When the tank is filled with
water it pulls the mill out of gear
and stops the pump; as a result
there can be no overflow or waste.
The tank is thus not allowed to
become empty and permit its drying
apart, inducing leakage. But
through the medium of the float
in the tank, when the water has been lowered but a few inches,
the mill is again put in gear and the tank refilled to the desired
height, at which the float is set.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—These have long been erroneously termed <em>windmill pumps</em> dating
to the time when wind furnished the power for driving <em>the grist mills used
in grinding grain, etc.</em> More properly they may now be named <em>windmotors</em>
or <em>airmotors</em>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p><em>The syphon pump</em> here illustrated, Fig. <a href="#fig_464">464</a>, is used to force
water from shallow wells to elevations. The cylinder or barrel
is situated within the standard and very convenient for inspection.
It has an air chamber which is detachable.</p>

<p><em>The subject of tanks and cisterns</em> is one
almost vital to the successful operations of
ordinary windmills, owing to the irregularity
of the power to be utilized by the use of aermotors.</p>

<p>In another part of this work this important
subject will be further explained and illustrated.</p>

<p><em>One of the most valuable special features of
this windmill is its governor.</em> It is so contrived
that it insures immunity of the mill from injuries
in destructive storms. It consists of a
steel coiled spring of great resiliency, located
at the base of the vane frame. Its strength is
of such a character as to hold the wheel in the
teeth of the wind under all ordinary conditions
but is sure to yield under greater pressure.</p>

<p>The preceding tables are based upon tests of the <em>Sampson
windmill</em> as compiled by its makers, The Stover Manufacturing
Co.; they deserve careful study by those planning the introduction
of aermotors.</p>

<p><em>The power of a windmill</em> depends—first, on the diameter of
the wheel; and second, on the velocity of wind. <em>To increase
the diameter of the wheel is to increase its power</em> in proportion
to the area of the squares. Table I gives the horse-power of
several sizes of mills working in a fifteen-mile wind: if the wind
velocity be increased or diminished, the power of the windmill
will increase or decrease in the ratio of the squares of the
velocity. Table V will show the comparative power or force
of the wind in velocities from eight to forty miles per hour for
each square foot of surface.</p>

<p><em>Rules for approximately determining size of windmill to use.</em></p>

<p>The daily water consumption must be given as a basis for
calculation. Divide this by 8 to find the hourly capacity of
windmill, as if loaded aright the mill will pump on an average
eight hours daily.</p>

<p><em>Multiply the quotient by total water lift in feet and with the
co-efficient given in Table II.</em></p>

<p>The product will in Table I show what mill to use.</p>

<p>The size of the cylinder and discharge pipe will be found
in Table III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_466">
<img src="images/i_p192.jpg" width="65" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 466.</span></p></div>

<p>Table I gives the maker’s number of the pumping mill, and
the number of gallons each will raise one foot high per hour, with
a wind having a velocity of fifteen miles per hour. Example:
No. 9 pump will raise 24,000 gallons of water one foot high in
one hour. Now if the water is to be raised 50 feet then by
dividing 24,000 by 50 the quantity raised becomes 480 gallons
per hour.</p>

<p>From Table V it will be seen also that a wind velocity of fifteen
miles per hour develops a power three times as great as
an eight-mile wind, and a twenty-mile wind is twice as powerful
as a fifteen-mile, or six times that of an eight-mile. Hence,
<em>a small increase in velocity greatly increases the power of the
windmill</em>, while a low velocity gives but little working force.</p>

<p>From Table VI it is seen that a twenty-five mile wind gives
six times as much power as a ten-mile wind, but really gives
twenty-six times <em>the net efficient power of the ten-mile wind</em>,
therefore it will not be proper to calculate on using a power
windmill in as low a velocity as ten miles.</p>

<p>From Table VII it is seen that the net efficient result is
six times as great in a fifteen-mile wind as in a ten-mile wind,
and sixteen times greater in a twenty-mile wind than in a ten-mile
wind. Therefore, <em>power windmills give best results when
working in fifteen to twenty-five mile winds</em>. A 12-foot power
windmill working in a fifteen-mile wind will do more work
than an average horse, and when working in a twenty-mile wind
will do more work than two average horses.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><em>Example.</em>—A person in Atlanta, Ga. uses 2,600 gallons of water daily.
He has a well in which the water stands 30 feet from ground level. To
obtain pressure, the water is to be elevated into a tank 50 feet above ground.
2,600 &divide; 8 = 325 gallons to be pumped hourly when windmill works.</p>

<p>Average wind velocity at Atlanta is 9 miles per hour, answering to coefficient
1.4 in Table II, and total water lift is 30 + 50 = 80 feet. 325 &times; 1.4 &times; 80
= 36,400 gallons.</p>

<p>If first estimate of 2,600 gallons daily was liberal, so that for instance
2,400 gallons would be sufficient, Table I shows that a 10-foot mill can be
used, but to keep on the safe side, choose a 12-foot mill. 325 gallons hourly
gives us in Table III 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inches cylinder with 2-inches discharge pipe as
proper sizes. If the 10-foot mill is chosen take the 3-inch cylinder.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>A 14-foot windmill working in a fifteen-mile wind will do
more work than two average horses, and when working in a
twenty-mile wind will do more work than four good horses,
while in a twenty-five mile wind it will do more work than
six good horses.</p>

<p><em>Giving the above tables a practical application</em>, a
little thought will disclose what a wealth of power
stands unappropriated and ready at hand to do
many of the drudgeries of work for which large expenditures
are annually made.</p>

<p>The uses of power windmills are so well understood
that it seems out of place to elaborate upon
them; the brief space allowed to giving information
as to the power of this class of mills when working
in different wind velocities, is best expressed in
tabular form, Table VI.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_466">466</a> represents the working barrel of a <em>deep
well pump</em>, such as are used frequently in connection
with the larger sizes of aermotors.</p>

<p>The tube is usually made of heavy brass—this is
<em>drawn</em> so perfectly, as to size and smoothness, that
a re-boring is not needed.</p>

<p>The plunger is here shown with four cup leather
packings, with one ball valve; the bottom valve is
also a ball with the seat resting within a conical
coupling at the bottom, this with a leather packing
makes a water tight joint.</p>

<p>Should any accident happen to the bottom valve
it may be withdrawn by lowering the sucker-rod
until the threaded portion comes in contact with the
nut underneath the plunger. By turning the sucker-rod
the nut engages the thread on the top of the
lower valve-cage. Then by withdrawing the sucker-rod both
valves may be drawn up for examination or repairs.</p>

<h3>ROTARY PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p>This class of pumps differs from the centrifugal pump, which
is described and illustrated hereafter, in that it includes a
<em>revolving piston</em>, while in the centrifugal pump there is a set of
<em>revolving blades</em> which acts upon the liquid in the same way
as a fan acts upon the air; <em>the centrifugal pump receives the
water in the center and throws it outward, while the rotary
gathers the fluid up and leads it towards a central discharge</em>.</p>

<p>The rotary pump substantially corresponds to the pressure
blower, and in many cases is simply the rotary engine reversed;
while the centrifugal pump is analogous to the fan-blower.
The functions of a rotary are almost identical with those of
piston and power plunger pumps.</p>

<p><em>The rotary pump on account of its cleanliness</em> has been
quite generally adopted for pumping all heavy liquids, such as
starch, paint, soap, gummy oils, beer and hops, sewerage,
bleachers, etc.</p>

<p>The rotary pump is used also in places where a piston or
steam pump would be objectionable either on account of floor
space occupied or for the reason that steam could not be had
without too much expense for lifting and forcing water and
other liquids which would not nor could not find their way
through the tortuous and narrow passages of the average piston
and plunger pumps.</p>

<p><em>For low heads of liquids</em> the rotary is also somewhat more
efficient than direct acting pumps and the absence of close fitting
parts renders it possible to handle water containing a considerable
quantity of impurities, such as silt, grain and gravel.
This type of pump is compact and is generally self-contained,
especially in the smaller sizes, and will deliver more water for a
given weight and space occupied than the reciprocating types,
while its simplicity of construction not only lessens the liability
to derangement, but enables persons having a limited knowledge
of machinery to set up and operate these pumps successfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>Rotary pumps are driven by means of belts from line shafting
and by wheel gearing, and also by direct connection to any
prime mover such as a steam or gas engine, hydraulic or electric
motor.</p>

<p><em>Rotary pumps may be divided into several classes</em> according
to the forms of, and methods of working the pistons or impellers,
as they are usually called, that is, according to the construction
and arrangement of the abutments. The abutment receives the
force of the water when driven forward by the pistons or impellers
and also prevents the water from being carried around
the cylinder, thus compelling
it to enter the delivery pipe.
<em>In the construction of the impellers
or pistons, and of the
abutments, lie the principal
differences in rotary pumps.</em>
In some pumps the abutments
are movable, and are arranged
to draw back, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig_469">469</a>, to allow the piston
to pass. In others the pistons
give way when passing fixed
abutments, and in others the
pistons are fitted with a movable
wing, as in Fig. <a href="#figs_471_472">472</a>, which slides radially in and out when
passing the abutment.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_469">
<img src="images/i_p196.jpg" width="300" height="329" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 469.</span></p></div>

<p>Pumps of this type having no packing and springs to prevent
leakage and in which the pistons work in cylindrical casings or
cylinders are quite durable and in many instances have been
known to run for months without stopping. The later construction
of this pump is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_470">470</a>; this design of
pump is more economical, as a rule, owing to the fact that
the strain on the belt is uniform at all points in the revolution
of the pistons.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_467">467</a>, page 194, represents one of the oldest and most
efficient forms of the rotary pump. Cog wheels, the teeth of
which are fitted to work accurately into each other, are inclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
in an elliptical case. The sides of these wheels turn close to
those of the case so that water cannot enter between them.
The axle of one of the wheels is continued through one end of
the case (which is removed in the figure to show the interior)
and the opening made tight by a stuffing-box or collar of
leather. A crank is applied at the end to turn it, and as one
wheel revolves it necessarily turns the other, the direction of
their motions being indicated by the arrows. The water that
enters the lower part of the case is swept up by the ends of each
cog in rotation; and as it cannot return between the wheels in
consequence of the cogs being always in contact there, it must
necessarily rise in the ascending or forcing pipe.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_468">468</a> represents a pump similarly
constructed to the foregoing, <em>but having cams</em> shaped so as to reduce
the wear.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_470">
<img src="images/i_p197.jpg" width="300" height="264" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 470.</span></p></div>

<p><em>In Eve’s pump</em>, shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_469">469</a>, a solid or hollow drum, <em>A</em>,
revolves in a cylindrical case. On the drum are three projecting
pieces, which fit close to the inner periphery of the case. The surface
of the drum revolves in contact with that of a smaller cylinder, <em>B</em>,
from which a portion is cut off to form a groove or recess sufficiently
deep to receive within it each piston as it moves past. The diameter
of the small cylinder is just one-third that of the drum. The axles
of both are continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198">198</a></span> through one or both ends of the case,
and the openings made tight with stuffing-boxes. On one end of each
axle is fixed a toothed wheel of the same diameter as its respective
cylinder; and these are so geared into one another, that when the crank
attached to the drum-axle is turned (in the direction of the arrow) the
groove in the small cylinder receives successively each piston, thus
affording room for its passage, and at the same time, by the contact
of the edge of the piston with its curved part, preventing water from
passing. As the machine is worked, the water that enters the lower part
of the pump through the suction-pipe is forced round and compelled to
rise in the discharging one, as indicated by the arrows. Other pumps of
the same class have a portion of the small cylinder cut off, so that
the concave surface of the remainder forms a continuation of the case
in front of the recess while the pistons are passing; and then, by a
similar movement to that in the figure described, the convex part is
brought in contact with the periphery of the drum until the return of
the piston.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In the year 1825, one Mr. J. Eve, an American, took out a patent
in England which was practically the beginning of the modern era of rotary
engines and pumps. His pump consisted chiefly of a revolving cylinder
having three teeth or projections and revolved within a case. A second and
smaller cylinder was also placed within this case. The smaller cylinder had
one side scooped out to permit each of the teeth upon the large cylinder to
pass as they came opposite the small cylinder. The two shafts being geared
together the small cylinder was caused to revolve three times to one of the
large so that the teeth might pass the small cylinder without interruption.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" id="figs_471_472">
<img src="images/i_p198.jpg" width="500" height="305" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 471 and 472.</span></p></div>

<p>The next improvement in rotary pumps is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_470">470</a>,
page 197. This type was used for many years as a fire pump.
The Silsby fire engine of the present day is practically this
pump in design although it has packing strips in the center of
each of the long teeth of the elliptical gears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>Following Eve’s invention were a series of claims which
embodied the design shown in the engraving, see Fig. <a href="#figs_471_472">471</a>,
where a sliding partition or abutment, A, was used to imprison
the steam. As the piston or inside cylinder turned around, the
abutment was pushed up and fell of its own gravity. A strip
of metal supported this abutment and furnished a suitable
wearing surface upon the surface of a revolving cylinder and also
accommodated itself to the tilting motion introduced by the
eccentricity of the revolving cylinder.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#figs_471_472">472</a> the sliding abutment has been placed in the
side of revolving cylinders and the axis of this cylinder is in
its center. In this case the abutment is pushed in by its pressure
upon the inside of the case and is thrown out by its
centrifugal force assisted by spiral springs.</p>

<p>The engraving, Fig. <a href="#fig_468">468</a>, gives a view of <em>Gould’s rotary
pump</em>, with the case removed; long practical experience has
demonstrated that the revolving cams or pistons are of such
a shape as to produce the minimum of friction and wear
with the greatest results.</p>

<p>The cases which receive these cams are engine lathe turned
and bored and so true and smooth that the cams when in
operation create almost a perfect vacuum and will “pick
up” water for a long distance and hold it efficiently. The
cams are carefully and accurately planed to mesh into each
other to fit their case.</p>

<p>It is a point worth noting that if a little good oil be put
into the case of these pumps before and after using at first, or
simply to pump air with the oil a few times, the cams become
as hard upon the surface as tempered steel, and are almost unaffected
by long use afterwards. Drip plugs are provided for
draining pumps in cold weather. To do this, turn the cams
backward a single revolution to release all water.</p>

<p><em>The Taber pump</em> is one of the best known of the rotary
class. It consists of three parts only, that is to say, (1) the
outside shell or case, (2) the piston, and (3) the valves.</p>

<p>Referring to the engravings herewith (Figs. <a href="#fig_474">474</a> to <a href="#figs_479_480_481">481</a>), the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
outside case or shell, A, is made either of brass or iron as the
case may be, Fig. <a href="#figs_475_476_477">476</a>, bored out at F to receive the piston, C,
Fig. <a href="#fig_478">478</a>, to which power is applied at G.</p>

<p>This cylinder has two heads or covers, BB, Figs. <a href="#figs_475_476_477">475</a> and <a href="#figs_475_476_477">477</a>,
which close the cylinder and has journal bearings to carry the
piston combined with packing boxes to prevent leakage of
the liquid passing through the pump. The valves, Figs. <a href="#figs_479_480_481">479</a>,
<a href="#figs_479_480_481">480</a> and <a href="#figs_479_480_481">481</a>, DDD, are plates of composition which slip

<p>These valves really perform the work of pumping. It will
be observed that substances which would easily clog up an
ordinary pump with clack valves, will pass through this pump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
without difficulty; there are no springs in this pump, nor will
it get out of order with the average treatment, and it pumps
all kinds of liquids, either thick or thin, such as are found between
the two extremes of water, and <em>brewers’ grains</em>.</p>

<p>It is designed to handle a large amount of fluids and semi-fluids
under a medium pressure, and being well balanced it
may be run fast or slow as desired.</p>

<p><em>Directions for setting and operating Taber pumps.</em></p>

<p>1st. Bolt pump firmly to the floor, and if possible set it so
that the liquid runs into it, which will add very much to the
life and duty of the pump.</p>

<p>2nd. See that all parts are well oiled.</p>

<p>3rd. Experience has proved that common candle wick
soaked in tallow is the best material with which to pack rotary
pumps. The wick should be double and twisted into a compact
rope and driven into the boxes as tightly as possible with a
piece of hard wood tapered to fit the box. Such a tool as described
is furnished with each pump. Do not under any circumstances
use iron calking tools which mar the bearing and causes
them to quickly cut out the packing.</p>

<p>4th. If from any cause the pump should become clogged,
do not use a lever in starting it. Remove the plug from
bottom and work the pulley back and forth till the pump is
relieved. If this does not free it, remove the outside head and
all parts will be accessible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Many of the modern breweries are built with the hop-jack
situated upon the upper floors of the brewery, to which the beer and hops
mixed are pumped, and the beer allowed to flow directly to the coolers.
This pump has been very successfully installed for the past five years, pumping
in some breweries 90 feet in height above the pump. The handling of
wet brewers’ grains by use of chain conveyors, which are seldom free from
infection and which are a continual source of annoyance from breakage, is
now overcome by this pump. All styles of these pumps can be washed out
clean after use, thereby overcoming entirely the noxious smell so disagreeable
to this part of the brewery when conveyors are used. There should be
a fall of six to eight feet from the wash-tub into the pump and as nearly
perpendicular as possible. Right angle bends in the discharge pipe should
also be avoided. By using twenty-four-inch bends wet grains at 70%
moisture can be pumped without additional water.</p></div>

<p>When putting heads back on the pump use ordinary <em>newspaper
for packing, nothing thicker</em>, as thicker packing destroys
the suction.</p>

<p>Prevent all leaks in suction pipe which would impair the
vacuum.</p>

<p>The suction should furnish an uninterrupted supply to the
pump, to enable the pump to throw its full capacity. Never
use pipes smaller than the openings in pump.</p>

<p>Open all drips in cold weather to prevent freezing.</p>

<p>All packing boxes should be kept in order and never allowed
to leak.</p>

<p>The illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig_482">482</a>, page 204, represents a rotary
pump of the Holyoke pattern to be attached by a clutch to a
line shaft—the gears, as shown, are merely to transmit the
power to the impellers. The safety valve with lever and weight,
shown in the cut, are designed to be attached to the discharge
pipe to guard against over pressure, which might occur through
the closing of valves.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_483">483</a> shows an emergency pump of the Holyoke rotary
pattern. It is of the same general design as the one previously
alluded to. It is driven directly from the line shaft by friction
gearing instead of toothed wheels. The hand wheel attached
to the end of a screw is used to press the smaller friction wheel
against the larger and thus transmit the power to drive the
pump.</p>

<p>This mechanism is not liable to injury by being thrown
instantly into gear in case of fire, as would be the case if gear
wheels were used.</p>

<p>These pumps are largely used in mills located in the Eastern
United States, <em>as they may be started up in a few moments at
full speed</em> without slowing down the engine or motor driving
the line shaft.</p>

<p>The shaft bearings are all made of large proportions to
avoid heating and excessive wear when suddenly put under
full load.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#fig_484">484</a> and <a href="#fig_485">485</a> are views of a <em>rotary pump driven by
steam</em> and largely used for fire apparatus. These pumps are
in general use in mills and factories, and can be installed wherever
the necessary steam and water supply are available.</p>

<p>The pump is built on a rigid iron base plate, and is furnished
with air chamber, water-pressure gauge, oil feeders and everything
necessary to make it complete and ready for permanent
steam and water connections. The discharge outlets can be
adapted for forcing water through either pipe or hose.</p>

<p>A perspective view of this pump is given in Fig. <a href="#fig_484">484</a> and a
sectional plan of the same appliance appears in Fig. <a href="#fig_485">485</a>.</p>

<p>Both engine and pump are of the rotary type and the construction
of these parts is precisely as described in connection
with its adaptation to use in the Silsby steam fire engine.</p>

<p>These pumps can be thoroughly drained and, with their
interior surface well coated with oil and No. 2 pure Graphite,
they can be “laid up” indefinitely and with certainty as to
their starting promptly when wanted in an emergency. Water
accumulated in the steam pipe will pass through this cylinder
without causing damage, and the free action of the pump will
not be defeated by the “sticking” of valves or the corrosion
of exposed parts.</p>

<p>In the operation of rotary pumps trouble is often experienced
through an improper adjustment of <em>the ends of the
case</em>. If the case is too long there will be leaks of water pass the
ends of the impellers and on the other hand if the case is too
short the ends of the impellers will bind and cut, through excessive
friction. Hence great care is necessary in adjusting the
ends of the case so that the pump may run freely yet without
leaks. The packing boxes around the shafts must not be
screwed up too tight otherwise the shaft will be injured.</p>

<p>It has been found by costly experience that <em>for emergency
fire pumps leather belts are unreliable</em>, hence these two pumps,
Figs. <a href="#fig_482">482</a> and <a href="#fig_483">483</a>, are driven by direct connection with the
shaft in the first instance and through cast iron friction gearing
in the second.</p>

<p>The engraving, Fig. <a href="#fig_487">487</a>, shows <em>Root’s rotary pump</em>. This
has two impellers which are geared together and each turn at
equal speeds towards one another at the top. The engraving,
Fig. <a href="#fig_488">488</a>, also shows a Root pump with <em>two impellers each having
three wings or lobes</em>. The
pump proper consists of half
circles, <em>AA</em>, with air chambers,
<em>DD</em>, cast with them, the head
plates, <em>B</em>, carrying the bearings,
and the revolvers, <em>CC</em>, together
with shafts, <em>EE</em>. The shafts
carry involute gears at each end
which keep the lobes of the
two impellers in their relative
positions, and rotate them.
Either shaft may be made the
driving shaft and to deliver
water, as shown by the arrows
in the cross section, the shafts revolve so that the tops move
toward one another.—Same as in the preceding case.</p>

<p><em>The action of this pump is as follows</em>: the suction pipe on
starting, being full of air, the first few revolutions of the pump
expel the air until the required vacuum is formed, which allows
atmospheric pressure to raise water into the pump. It then flows
between the case and the lobes into the space, <em>F</em>, and is carried by
the impellers to the discharge edge of the case, point, <em>G</em>, where it
enters the discharge pipe. Each succeeding lobe brings up an amount
of water equal to spaces, <em>FF</em>, thus delivering the contents of the
six at each revolution. The irregular form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
the lobes keeps them in contact at the center line, thus preventing the
return of water into the suction below.</p>

<p>Heads of water from 10 to 250 feet are successfully handled
by this type of pump, with a slip of from 5 to 15 per cent.,
according to the discharge pressure.</p>

<p>The three-lobe impellers provide a double lock against the
return of water between the case and impellers, at the same
time allowing a very free inlet and outlet for the water. The
delivery of water from this pump is smooth and continuous.</p>

<p>The large engraving, Fig. <a href="#fig_486">486</a>, page 208, shows the exterior
of this same pump with journal bearings and gears
encased at each end. This pump may be driven by motor or
engine.</p>

<p><em>Large rotary pumps for dredging purposes</em> with their engine
equipment for <em>salt water service</em>, include surface condenser
outfits with air pumps, feed pumps, fire pumps, etc. The
dredges <em>for fresh water</em> are very large cross-compound engines,
double-acting air pumps and jet condensers with the
usual complement of vertical duplex feed pumps, fire pumps,
etc. The air pumps are of a very novel arrangement, inasmuch
as it is possible by the manipulation of valves and cocks provided
for the purpose to separate the pumps and run one
side entirely independent of the other side. These dredges
are self-propelling and sea-going; some of them are fitted with
immense bins in which the dredged material is deposited, and
when full, the vessel propels herself out to deep water, dumps
the sand or mud and steams back to repeat the operation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The operation of these machines is very interesting. A long
flexible tube 12 to 15 inches in diameter drops down from the side of the
vessel 20 to 30 feet or more to the bottom of the river or harbor upon which
the dredging operation is being performed. The upper end of this tube is
connected to an immense rotative centrifugal pump revolving at several
hundred revolutions per minute and capable of handling many hundreds of
tons of water per hour. The lower end of the tube is manipulated from the
vessel against the sand bars and mud banks and as the water is sucked upward
by the centrifugal pumps a very large proportion of sand and mud goes
with it. The centrifugal pumps discharge this water with its suspended
material into the tanks on board the vessel or into scows, where the heavy
material quickly settles to the bottom, the water flowing back into the sea.</p>

<p>The mixture of sand and water which is drawn up the suction pipe is
forced a distance of 3,800 feet through a 30-inch pipe to the place where it is
to be deposited; the water draining off allows the solid matter to remain.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<h3>CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p><em>The centrifugal pump raises the liquid to be displaced, by
means of a rapidly revolving fan</em> having two or more blades
straight or curved, fastened upon a shaft and fitting closely into
a case having an inlet for water at the end center and an outlet
at one side or on top of the case tangent to the circle described
by the fan.</p>

<p>Most people are practically acquainted with the principle
of the centrifugal pump, viz., that by which a body revolving
round a center tends to recede from it, and with a force proportioned
to its velocity: thus mud is thrown from the rims of
carriage wheels, when they move rapidly over wet roads; a
stone in a sling darts off the moment it is released; a bucket of
water may be whirled like a stone in a sling and the contents
retained even when the bottom is upwards.</p>

<p><em>The earliest history of the centrifugal pump</em> cannot be
traced, but it is known that centrifugal machines for lifting
liquids were in use during the latter part of the seventeenth
century. About 1703, Denis Papin, the famous French engineer,
designed his “Hessian Suck,” a form of centrifugal
pump embodying nearly all of the essential features of the
present-day machine. Drawings of this pump are in existence
which show that Papin was not only a designer of no mean
ability, but that he had a good comprehension of the principles
with which he was dealing. After Papin there seems to have
been no further development of his ideas until 1818, when the
earliest prototype of the present form of centrifugal was
brought out in Massachusetts and has since been known as the
“<em>Massachusetts pump</em>.” This pump was of the type designated
“volute,” and was provided with double suction openings and
an open impeller. It was re-invented by Andrews and others
in 1846, and was shortly afterwards introduced into England
by Mr. John Gwynne.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The term “volute” so frequently used in connection with these
means “<em>a spiral scroll of plate</em>.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>Centrifugal pumps have now attained a degree of perfection,
which makes them a serious rival of the plunger pumps. The
high-class turbine pumps of to-day are simply machines in
which the water is given a velocity which is partially changed
to pressure before discharge, and the pump is designed so that
the well-known actions, outlined above, proceed along natural
lines, which are, to use the common phrase, lines of least
resistance. It is simply a question of careful design.</p>

<p>The modern pump causes the water to flow along paths naturally due
to the forces acting and to guide the stream in such a way as to avoid
the production of eddies and whirls within itself which so enormously
cut down the efficiency.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_489">
<img src="images/i_p212.jpg" width="300" height="310" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 489.</span></p></div>

<p>The blades now take the form of “impellers” which have warped
surfaces whose form is the result of careful calculation, and the
water, after leaving the impellers, is guided by vanes of equally
and carefully calculated form. <em>It is owing to the correct form of
the guide vanes</em> that the nearly perfect conversion of velocity into
pressure head is possible, and this is the principal factor which
produces the high efficiency shown in tests.</p>

<p>When pumping against high heads, the units are arranged
in stages or series. The discharge from one is led to the inlet
of the next in series, the separate units being usually mounted
on one shaft, and the whole really forms one machine. In this
manner heads approaching 2,000 feet are worked, still preserving
the high efficiency which in some cases reaches between
80 and 90 per cent.</p>

<p>The ability to generate such pressures enables them to be
used for feeding boilers, and their efficiency particularly commends
them for this purpose.</p>

<p>The centrifugal pump is <em>the converse of the turbine water-wheel</em>.
Its development has been analogous to that of the steam turbine in that
both were abandoned in favor of reciprocating machines before having
been thoroughly exploited; the pump because the principles of its
action were not clearly understood, and the steam turbine because of
mechanical difficulties in its construction.</p>

<p>Opposite the title page of this book can be seen a representation
of a centrifugal wheel of <em>ten thousand horse power</em>; it will repay
the careful student to consult also page 133 of part one of this work
for the details of this enormous machine; the curious will also be
interested in an early form of the centrifugal pump to be seen in Fig.
<a href="#fig_489">489</a> and its description in the Note on page 214.</p>

<p>Where large quantities of water are to be moved quickly
and more especially in cases where the water is impure and
contains floating matter, as well as sand, mud, coal and the like,
as in wreckage, the centrifugal pump has its peculiar advantages.
It is suited particularly for use in tanneries, paper mills, dry
docks, corporation work such as building sewers, sand dredging,
and with water that contains large quantities of solid matter held
in suspension. Pumps used for these purposes have to be primed
on starting, and the suction pipe should be as short as possible.
Long suction pipes very much impair the efficiency of this type
of pump. They will draw water upwards of twenty feet but
nothing like the full capacity of the pump can be realized under
such circumstances. It is always better to lower the pump as
much as possible and force the water instead of trying to suck it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Upon page 212 is represented one of the very earliest types of a
turbine pump, an account of which is left by Ewbanks, to whose book on
hydraulics credit should be given for the figure. “This pump consists of
tubes united in the form of a cross or letter <span class="sans"><b>T</b></span> placed perpendicularly in the
water to be raised. The lower end is supported on a pivot; perforations are
made to admit the water, and just above them a valve to retain it when the
pump is not in motion. The ends of the transverse part are bent downward
to discharge the water into a circular trough, over which they revolve. To
charge it the orifices may be closed by loosely inserting a cork into each and
then filling the pump through an opening at the top which is then closed by
a screw-cap. A rapid rotary motion is imparted to the machine by a pulley
fixed on the axis and driven by a band, from a drum, &amp;c. The centrifugal
force thus communicated to the water in the arms or transverse tube, throws
it out; and the atmosphere pushes more water up the perpendicular tube
to supply the place of that ejected. These pumps are sometimes made with
a single arm like the letter <span class="sans"><b>L</b></span> inverted; at others quite a number radiate
from the upright tube. It has also been made of a series of tubes arranged
round a vertical shaft in the form of an inverted cone. A valuable improvement
was submitted by M. Jorge to the French Academy in 1816. It consists
in imparting motion to the arms only, thus saving the power consumed in
moving the upright tube, and by which the latter can be inclined as circumstances
or locations may require.”</p></div>

<p>Centrifugal pumps designed to raise clean water alone
should not be used for any other purpose, that is to say, pumps
for handling more or less solid matter mixed with the water
have much more clearance in the case than those for pumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
clean water. The fan is also made differently so that it cannot
be clogged up by lumps of coal, gravel, and sticks of wood.
The accompanying engravings, Figs. <a href="#fig_490">490</a>, <a href="#fig_491">491</a> and <a href="#fig_492">492</a>, illustrate
these ideas, showing the three progressive grades of fans for
the kinds of work alluded to.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_490">490</a> shows a fan with hollow arms for clean water only.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_491">491</a> shows the disc type of fan for water containing
grit, pulp, etc.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_492">492</a> exhibits a fan used in dredging pumps used for all
sorts of stuff that will pass through the connecting pipes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_493">
<img src="images/i_p215.jpg" width="500" height="423" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 493.</span></p></div>

<p>There are two general types of centrifugal pumps, viz.,
1, <em>single suction</em>, Fig. <a href="#fig_493">493</a>, in which the suction pipe enters the
end of case parallel to, and in line with its center; 2, <em>the double
suction</em>, Fig. <a href="#fig_494">494</a>, in which the suction pipe is divided forming
a <span class="sans"><b>U</b></span> shape and enters the case at both sides of the center.</p>

<p>The single suction is used for clear water only, while the
double suction will pass everything that enters the suction
pipe—see engravings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>When the pump is located above the water, it has to be
primed before it will raise water. For these purposes an ejector,
or exhauster, is frequently employed, which will exhaust the
air and draw water up from the required depth. The arrangement
of the ejector is illustrated at A, in Fig. <a href="#fig_496">496</a>, and is
the smallest and most convenient contrivance that can be used
for this work. It is screwed into the highest part of the pump,
and is connected by a separate steam pipe to boiler. In a short
time after turning on steam, the
pump will be primed, the pump
remaining stationary during the
operation of priming.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_494">
<img src="images/i_p216.jpg" width="261" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 494.</span></p></div>

<p>To prevent air returning through the discharge pipe, a check valve,
B, is used. For larger pumps a gate valve is generally employed
here.</p>

<p>A foot valve fitted with a strainer to keep out obstructions likely
to clog the pump should be used as it keeps the pump primed and ready
for immediate use.</p>

<p>The general form of the blades is of great importance in this type
of pump, because the water is driven through the fan partly by the
pressure of the blades on the water and partly by centrifugal force.
The ratio which each of these forces bears to the other varies in the
same pump, depending upon the proportion the speed bears to the height
of it. With low lifts and high speed the water is discharged with but
little rotary motion, the resistance to the outward motion of the water
being so small that the oblique action of the blades is sufficient to
effect the discharge without imparting to the water the same speed
of rotation as is given to the fan. The principal object in<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
this type of pump is to effect the discharge of as large a volume of
water as possible with the least rotary motion. The power absorbed in
imparting the latter motion is not given up later on and consequently
is lost, while the rotary motion tends to impede the flow of water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_495">
<img src="images/i_p217.jpg" width="600" height="511" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 495.</span></p></div>

<p>The passage through the pump should be so timed as to
produce a gradually increasing velocity in the water until it
reaches the circumference of the fan, then a gradually decreasing
velocity until it is discharged from the pipe. These conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
are met by having a conical end to the suction pipe,
and a spiral casing surrounding the fan. The form of the casing
should be such that the water flowing round the casing will
move with the same velocity as that issuing from the fan; the
casing enlarges from that locality into the discharge pipe.</p>

<p>A small increase in the number of revolutions of the fan
after the pump commences to discharge produces a large increase
in the volume of water delivered.</p>

<p>The engraving Fig. <a href="#fig_497">497</a> exhibits a <em>steam-driven centrifugal
pump</em> of an approved design constructed by the <em>Morris Machine
Works</em>.</p>

<p>This pump is directly connected to the engine and has a
double suction. Pumps directly connected to engines are to
be preferred over belt-driven pumps when conditions of elevation,
etc., will allow, as they are self-contained, take up less
space and are more economical.</p>

<p>The figure 498 shows a 20-inch <em>hydraulic dredge</em>, directly
connected to a 450 horse-power triple-expansion engine. A hydraulic
dredge consists mainly of a centrifugal pump with its
driving engine and boiler, and hoisting machinery for handling
suction pipe and boat; the pump in operation creates a strong
suction flow in the suction pipe, sufficient to pick up the
material and draw it into the pump, from which it is again delivered
through the discharge pipe any distance to point of delivery,
and can at same time be elevated to reasonable heights.
Sand, mud, silt, etc., are readily picked up by the suction force
only, but where material is packed it must first be agitated.</p>

<p>The steam shovel, bucket or elevator dredge will do efficient
service in raising material, but none are capable of delivering
the material except within a very short radius of the dredging
operation. The centrifugal dredge not only raises the material,
but also delivers it at the place wanted, at one operation.
<em>Besides, it is practically impossible to build any other type</em> with
the enormous capacity that some hydraulic dredges have.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_499">499</a> is a perspective view of a centrifugal vertical pump of
<em>the submerged type</em>. This pump is used largely by contractors in
excavations and coffer dam work and for keeping pits drained.</p>

<p>A double suction centrifugal pump, <em>driven directly by a
steam engine</em>, is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_497">497</a>; these are generally and
very satisfactorily used for circulating water through surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
condensers and the cooling pipes in refrigerating systems. The
engine and pump thus combined occupy small floor space and
consequently little masonry is required for a foundation.</p>

<p><em>The Buffalo centrifugal pump</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_500">500</a>. These
are built by the Buffalo Forge Co. in two types, viz., the submerged
and the suction; the latter is the one shown in the cut.
The suction type is employed for pumping from mines, pits,
etc., and all places where the supply will not allow of a horizontal
pump to be used, or in others where the supply is either
below the pump, <em>or sometimes above and at other times below</em>.
This type possesses merit above the submerged design in that it
will work equally well, when set either above or below the
liquid to be pumped.</p>

<p><em>Multi-stage centrifugal pumps.</em> Experience has demonstrated
that by placing several pumps together and discharging
from one into the other, water can be delivered to almost any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
height. For a long time after the introduction of centrifugal
pumps, it was supposed that about sixty feet was the limit for
their economical working, owing to the high speed at which
they had to be run to accomplish the results desired.</p>

<p>It was a discovery of importance, that <em>by coupling two or
more pumps in series</em>, so that each pump worked against only
a part of the total delivery head, water could easily be raised
to even two thousand feet or any reasonably high head with
satisfactory efficiency. Pumps connected in this way will
throw more water at a given speed than when operated separately,
and are therefore attended by less wear and tear.</p>

<p>Pumps worked in series are built compound, triple or
quadruple as required by service either belt driven or directly
connected to engines. Owing to the fact that they have no
valves or absolutely close-parts, they are able to pump muddy
or gritty water with sand in suspension, and are, therefore,
especially in the vertical type, the only ones that can be successfully
used for draining deep mines.</p>

pump</em>, or a quadruple compound pump capable of lifting water
250 feet.</p>

<p><em>Explanation of diagram page 225.</em> In determining the requirements
best suited as regards rotation of shaft and connection
with the suction and discharge pipes, in installing a
pump, the figure <a href="#fig_502">502</a>, will be found a convenience. It is important
to run the most direct pipes with the least number of
elbows or bends.</p>

<p>The diagram relates particularly to the centrifugal pumps
made by the Morris Machine Works of Baldwinsville, N. Y.;
the principle is, however, of general application. In making use
of the diagram each number represents a particular design.
See Note.</p>

<p><em>How to determine right-or left-hand pumps.</em> If, when standing
at the suction end of pump, looking over the pump shell
toward the pulley, the top of the shaft revolves from right to
left, or <em>against the hands of clock</em>, the pump is <em>right-hand</em>, and
from left to right, or <em>with the hands of clock</em>, it is <em>left-hand</em>.</p>

<p><em>Directions for erecting and running centrifugal pumps.</em>
Place the pump as near suction water as possible, and limit
suction lift to 20 feet or 25 feet.</p>

<p>Erect the pump so that the pump shaft is level; in bolting
to foundation be careful that the frame is not sprung. See
that the bearings are clean and well oiled. The suction pipe
and stuffing-boxes must be air-tight.</p>

<p>Never use pipes smaller than those represented by the
flanges on the pump; avoid elbows or bends as much as possible;
if discharging long distances, use pipes one or two sizes
larger than ordinary.</p>

<p>Whether a foot valve is used or not, a strainer should be
attached to the suction pipe to prevent large substances from
entering, that might choke or clog the pump, but be careful
that suction area is not contracted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In viewing diagrams on page 225 you are supposed to stand at
the outer half of pump shell looking over pump towards the pulley or
engine, if directly connected. <em>The pump can be swiveled around the frame</em>,
so that, for instance, if you order pump per diagram No. 50, it can after
receipt be made Nos. 51, 52 or 53.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p><em>Run the pump in proper direction, as indicated by arrows cast
on the pump shell.</em></p>

<p>If the combined length of suction and discharge pipe is
more than 50 feet, the speed must be increased to overcome
friction.</p>

<p>Before starting, prime the pump so that suction pipe and
pump are filled with water.</p>

<p>Warm water can only be raised by suction to moderate
heights, and if very hot it must flow to the pump. To prevent
freezing in cold weather, drain by unscrewing plug provided in
the bottom of the pump shell.</p>

<p>Sometimes a pump when first started will deliver a good
stream of water, which gradually diminishes in volume until it
stops entirely. One reason for this is a leak in suction pipes
or stuffing-box of pump, or, when suction primer is used, in the
hand pump stuffing-box. Another reason might be that the
pump lowers the suction supply, thus increasing the lift until
there is not sufficient speed for the elevation. If the pump
works indifferently, delivering a stream obviously too small, it is
generally because the pump was not properly primed and some
air remains in the top part of pump shell. Unless primed by
steam ejector, the pet cock or plug found on top of pump shell
should always be open while priming, and the pump must not
be started until water flows out of same.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—“One feature or fact in centrifugal pumping that is overlooked
or not known to many makers, is that water will not enter a pump when
the impeller vanes sweep over the inlet way and are driven at high speed.
To illustrate this, one can not thrust a cane or lath through the spokes of a
rapidly revolving wheel. European centrifugal pumps with their small impellers
and consequent high speed of rotation, are especially liable to this
repelling action, and very often are wholly inefficient from this cause. One
maker who claims a high duty for his pumps, attaches a screw at the sides
of the impeller to coax the water into the pump, and the idea is a good one
if the difficulty is not otherwise provided for. In this way a pump can be
made of smaller diameter for a given duty, but it is commonly inferior to a
larger one for the same work.”—<em>Industries.</em></p></div>

<p>A pump with horizontal top discharge and short length of
discharge pipe is sometimes difficult to start, especially if
suction lift is high, owing to the fact that the water is thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
out of the pump shell before the water in the suction pipe has
got fairly started, thus allowing air to rush back into the pump.
If the pump is to work under this condition, it is better to use
a pump with a vertical discharge and deliver through an elbow,
or else lead the discharge pipe upward for a short distance so
as to keep a slight pressure, or head on the pump, and after
priming as high as possible start quickly.</p>

<p>Generally nothing is gained by running a pump above the
proper speed required for a given elevation.</p>

<p>In addition to what is said in connection with the priming
device illustrated on page 218, numerous other methods have
been adopted to suit pumps of various designs. The accompanying
engravings represent those largely used.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#figs_1_2_3">1</a> illustrates a multi-stage turbine pump with ejector for
priming. The ejector is connected to the highest point on the
pump casing, and either steam, air or water under pressure may
be employed in it to produce a vacuum.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#figs_1_2_3">2</a> shows an auxiliary hand pump mounted on top of
the discharge casing. When the pump is ready to start, the
gate valve on the discharge is closed, and by operating the
hand pump a vacuum is produced and water drawn in, filling the
suction pipe and casing.</p>

<p>The method of priming shown in Fig. <a href="#figs_1_2_3">3</a> may be resorted to
where a foot valve is used on the suction pipe. Water is
allowed to run into the pump until it reaches the discharge
flange, when the supply is shut off, and the pump may be
started.</p>

<p>After the pump has been properly primed, it should be
started before the gate valve on the discharge is opened. When
full speed is reached, the discharge gate may be slowly opened,
and the pump will perform its work.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—<em>The Worthington centrifugal pumps</em> are divided into three
classes, viz.: <em>Conoidal</em>, <em>Volute</em> <em>and Turbine</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Conoidal Centrifugals</em> (<em>named from the cone-shaped impeller</em>) are
designed especially for low lifts and large deliveries and are adapted to irrigation
work, the handling of sewage and similar purposes. They are
comparatively inexpensive and operate at high rotative speeds, making possible
direct connection to electric motors. <em>For heads up to 30 feet</em> they are
unexcelled in the pumping field.</p>

<p><em>The Volute Centrifugals</em> (illustrated on page 232) are built for medium
lifts, but for all capacities. Since they run at moderate speeds, diffusion
vanes are not needed, but the volute casing has been carefully designed to
obtain high efficiency and 86% has been shown under test. These pumps are
recommended <em>for heads up to 70 feet</em>, although they will safely withstand
150 feet.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>
<p>It is always best to use a foot valve in connection with
centrifugal pumps where the lift is more than three to four feet, and
even under these low lifts where long suction pipes are used to conduct
water long distances, foot valves should always be used to keep the
pump and suction pipe charged.</p>

<h3 id="TURBINE_PUMPS">TURBINE PUMPS.</h3></div>

<p><em>The Turbine Pump</em> is suited to very high lifts, <em>even exceeding
2,000 feet</em>. An admirable example of this class of pumps
is described in the following paragraphs:</p>

<p>The Worthington turbine pump has been developed by a
long series of experiments. <em>The diffusion vanes</em> which form
the distinguishing feature, take the place of the usual whirlpool
chamber and assist in bringing the water to rest without internal
commotion or shock. They correspond in function to <em>the
guide vanes of turbine water-wheels</em>. One of the difficulties
presented by high-lift centrifugal pumps has been the great
peripheral speed required when only a single impeller is employed.
<em>This has been overcome by mounting a number of discs
or impellers, each operating in a separate chamber, upon a single
shaft and passing the water through the impeller chambers in
succession.</em> The lift can thus be multiplied three, four or five
times, while the number of revolutions is kept within bounds.
It has been demonstrated that on the same work and within
reasonable limits, multi-stage centrifugals are more efficient
than single-stage pumps, the increased efficiency being due to
<em>a decrease in the frictional losses</em> coincident with the reduced
peripheral speed of the impeller.</p>

<p>It is well known that the turbine water wheel was perfected
less by mathematical processes than by intelligent cut and try
methods. It has been the same with the turbine pump, whereby
the vanes and passages have been shaped and tested by
practical experiments, followed in each case by comparison of
results. The constant aim has been to avoid eddies and secure
a favorable discharge of the water.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—At the St. Louis World’s Exposition three of the 36-inch
Worthington turbine pumps, each of a capacity of 35,000 gallons per minute
against 160 feet head, supplied the Grand Cascade.</p></div>

The ills. on the opposite page (Fig. <a href="#fig_503">503</a>), which represents
in outline a Worthington turbine pump, indicates the
difficulty of exactly and mathematically designing such a
mechanism. In the system shown only suction and discharge
pipes are employed, the water entering axially and issuing
radially. <em>The impellers</em> remain in perfect longitudinal balance
regardless of their number or the head against which the pump
is operated, this balancing of the impeller being secured by an
ingenious system of “triple vanes.”</p>

<p><em>The diffusion vanes.</em> In the Worthington turbine pump the
efficient conversion of energy is assured by an original system
of diffusion vanes disposed in the throat opening between the
periphery of the impeller and the annular casing, in much the
same manner that guide vanes are placed in a reaction turbine
water-wheel. These vanes form tangential, expanding ducts
from which the fluid emerges at about the velocity existing in
the chamber. They also eliminate all drag and friction between
the periphery of the rapidly revolving impeller and the slowly
moving water in the discharge chamber.</p>

<p>The turbine pump has created an entirely new field of application
for centrifugal pumps, embracing mine drainage,
water-works, and numerous other services where rotary pumps
are desirable but have not been employed, owing to their
former limited efficiency at high heads.</p>

<p>As a sinking or station pump for mine service, the turbine
pump is ideal. There are no valves, guards or springs, no reciprocating
parts, and, most important of all, there is no contact
surface in the machine except the shaft and its bearings.
The design is such that parts subjected to the action of mine
water may be made of acid-resisting metal, and, when desired,
lead-lined.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The space occupied by the turbine pump is less than one-third
of that required by a reciprocating pump of equal capacity, and the first
cost, including the motor for driving, is only about one-half. Since there
are no rubbing surfaces exposed to the water, the pump will run for years
without renewal or repairs. In case of accident, the parts are so few and
the construction so simple that any part of the machine can be replaced in
less than one hour. The cost of attendance is reduced to the minimum,
since the only necessary attention is to see that the pumps and motors are
properly lubricated. The simplicity and reliability of the centrifugal pump
make it especially suitable for isolated stations.</p></div>

<p>Turbine pumps of excellent design (Fig. <a href="#fig_507">507</a>) of high
efficiency are built by the Byron Jackson Machine Works of
San Francisco, California. The operating elements of these
pumps are rotating impellers containing spirally-curved water
passages, and fixed guide passage between successive impellers.
The water enters the passages of each impeller <em>at the center</em>
and by the rotation is forced out into a collecting chamber surrounding
the periphery of the impeller. The ducts which lead
the water from there back to the center of the next impeller
are suitably curved to act as guide passages, similar in action
to the guide buckets of a turbine. The water then enters the
next impeller parallel with the shaft, its rotary motion having
been transformed by the guide passages into rectilinear motion.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_509">509</a>, a drawing of a vertical pump in section, shows the
relative arrangement of impellers (marked A) and guide passages
(B). This pump has the suction entrance at the top;
the discharge leaves the collecting chamber of the last (lowest)
impeller tangent to the circle. The shaft rests in a thrust
bearing at the top, and is further held by bearings formed in
the successive sections of the case. At the bottom it is provided
with a special balancing arrangement, described here
after.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_508">
<img src="images/i_p238.jpg" width="230" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 508.</span></p></div>

<p>Each impeller, where it joins the guide passages of the preceding
case section, is fitted into the case so as to form as
tight a joint as possible without introducing any great frictional
resistance to rotation. With the exception of the entrance
opening, the external surface of the impeller is exposed to the
delivery pressure, so that there is a resultant upward pressure
on each impeller, equal to the area of its entrance multiplied
by the difference between the entrance and discharge pressures
of that stage. If all the impellers are alike, the total upward
thrust is equal to the product of entrance area multiplied by
the total head on the pump. The pumps are so proportioned
that this upward thrust slightly exceeds the weight of the
rotating portion, consisting of impellers and shaft. <em>The excess
of upward pressure, however, is relieved by the balancing device
located at the lower end of the shaft, with the result that the</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
<em>rotating part is precisely balanced, thus relieving the thrust
bearing of all load while the pump is running.</em></p>

<p>The balancing device referred to consists of two chambers,
C and D, formed centrally in the bottom of the lowest section
of the pump case. The large chamber, C, encloses a projecting
hub, E, on the lower surface of the impeller. This hub of
course rotates with the impeller, and the joint between the hub
and the walls of the chamber is, therefore, loose enough to
allow water from the delivery side of the last impeller to leak
into chamber, C, and establish the full discharge pressure in
that chamber. The small lower chamber, D, contains a plug,
H, which may be adjusted endways by means of screws. The
forward end of this plug fits closely into a recess in the
face of the hub, E, which recess, communicates, by way of the
hollow central part of the hub and the passage, <em>g</em>, with the
entrance side of the last impeller.</p>

<p>The action of the device is as follows: when chamber, C,
becomes filled with water, or rather when leakage through the
joint around the tube, E, has raised the pressure in the
chamber, C, to the delivery pressure, the total upward pressure
on the impellers is greater than the total weight of the rotating
part of the pump. The rotating element is therefore lifted
until the recess in hub, E, is raised clear of the plug, H. In
this position the pressure in chamber, C, is relieved through
the passage, <em>g</em>, with the result that the rotating element again
settles down over the adjusting plug, H. As this action tends
to recur, a position of equilibrium is established near the point
where the plug just enters the recess in the hub, E. The
precise position of this point may be altered by the adjusting
screws of the plug, H, thereby adjusting the endwise position
of the impellers in the casing. When the pump is not in
operation, of course the upward pressure of the water does not
act, and the weight of the rotating part must be carried by the
thrust bearing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_509">
<img src="images/i_p240.jpg" width="328" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 509.</span></p></div>

<p>When these pumps are built with horizontal shaft, the unbalanced
pressure which is thus turned to account in the vertical
pump becomes harmful and must be avoided. The arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
by which this is accomplished is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_510">510</a>, where
the letters, A and B, designate respectively the impellers and
the guide passages as before. The rear of each impeller, that
is, the side opposite the entrance opening, bears a short annular
projection, S, fitting within a similar ring, <em>t</em>, projecting from
the casing. The circular chamber formed by these two rings
communicates, through holes, V, in the web of the impeller,
with the entrance side of the impeller. The chamber being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
slightly larger than the entrance opening of the impeller, it
serves to eliminate all thrust on the impeller in the direction
of the suction (since the remainder of the external surface is
exposed to the discharge pressure), and produces instead a
small thrust directed toward the discharge end.</p>

<p>This small resultant thrust is taken up by a balancing device
at the end of the shaft precisely similar to that used in the
vertical type of pump, as previously described. The balancing
action thus secured serves to fix the endwise position of the
rotating part; moreover, it affords sufficient margin to compensate
for longitudinal thrusts which may result from causes
such as slightly non-central position of the impellers in their
casing.</p>

<p>Pumps of this design are built for heads of from 100 to
2,000 ft., the number of separate impellers or “stages” being
properly proportioned to the head. <em>About 100 to 250 ft. head
per stage</em> appears to be allowed. A high efficiency of working,
from 70 to 80%, is said to be realized.</p>

<p><em>The horizontal two-stage pump</em> shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_507">507</a> is one
built for the water-works of the city of Stockton, Cal., to deliver
1,500 gallons per minute against a head of 140 ft., at 690 r. p.
m. It is driven by a 75-HP. induction motor of the Westinghouse
Electric &amp; Mfg. Co. type, of Pittsburg, Pa. Pump
and motor are mounted on a common base, and their shafts
are solidly coupled. This pump was guaranteed to have an
efficiency of at least 75%, but we are informed by the manufacturers
that the official test showed it to have an efficiency
of 82%.</p>

<p><em>The vertical pump of four stages</em>, shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_508">508</a>, has
a discharge capacity of 450 gallons per minute and delivers
against a head of 500 ft. The same type of pump, however,
will work against heads up to 800 ft. The mounting of the
pump in the present instance is at the bottom of a 200-ft. pit;
the pump shaft leads vertically to the surface, where it is driven
by belt. A closely similar installation has been made, where
two vertical three-stage pumps operate under a head of 310 ft.
The pumps are located in a 30-ft. pit, and their shafts are extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
to the surface, where they carry each a 200-HP. induction
motor mounted directly on the shaft. The balancing
action of the pump was in this case designed to be sufficient to
carry the entire weight of the rotating part, that is, motor, shaft
and pump impellers.</p>

<h3>THE INJECTOR.</h3></div>

<p><em>This consists, in its most simple form, of a steam nozzle, the
end of which extends somewhat into the second nozzle, called the
combining or mixing nozzle; this connects with, or rather terminates
in, a third nozzle or tube, termed “the forcer.”</em> At the
end of the <em>combining tube</em>, and before entering the forcer, is an
opening connecting the interior of the nozzle at this point with
the surrounding space. This space is connected with the outside
air through a check valve, opening outward in the automatic
injectors, and by a valve termed the overflow valve. The injector
nozzles are tubes, with ends trumpet mouthed to receive
and deliver the fluids with the least possible loss by friction
and eddies.</p>

<p>As a thermodynamical machine, the injector is nearly perfect,
since all the heat received by it is returned to the boiler,
except a very small part which is lost by radiation; consequently
its thermal efficiency should be in every case nearly
100 per cent.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The operation of the injector is based on the fact, first demonstrated
by Giffard, that the motion imparted by a jet of steam to a surrounding
column of water is sufficient to force it into the boiler from which the
steam was taken, and, indeed, into a boiler working at a higher pressure.
The steam escaping from under pressure has, in fact, a much higher velocity
than water would have under the same pressure and condition. The rate
of speed at which steam travels—taking it at an average boiler pressure of
sixty pounds—when discharged into the atmosphere, is about 1,700 feet
per second. When discharged with the full velocity developed by the
boiler pressure through a pipe, say an inch in diameter, the steam encounters
the water in the combining chamber. It is immediately condensed and
its bulk will be reduced say 1,000 times, but its velocity remains practically
undiminished. Uniting with the body of water in the combining tube, it
imparts to it a large share of its speed, and the body of water thus set in
motion, operating against a comparatively small area of boiler pressure, is
able to overcome it and flow into the boiler. The weight of the water to
which steam imparts its velocity gives it a momentum that is greater in the
small area in which its force is exerted than the boiler pressure, although its
force has actually been derived from the boiler pressure itself.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>All injectors are similar in their operation. They are designed
to bring a jet of live steam from the boiler in contact
with a jet of water so as to cause it to flow continuously in the
direction taken by the steam, the velocity of which it in part
assumes, back into the boiler and against its own pressure.</p>

<p>There are three distinct types of live steam injectors, the
“simple fixed nozzle,” the “adjustable nozzle,” and the
“double.” The first has one steam and one water nozzle
which are fixed in position but are so proportioned as to yield
good results. There is a steam pressure for every instrument
of this type at which it will give a maximum delivery, greater
than the maximum delivery for any other steam pressure either
higher or lower.</p>

<p>The second type has but one set of nozzles, but they can
be so adjusted relative to each other as to produce the best results
throughout a long range of action; that is to say, it so
adjusts itself that its maximum delivery continually increases
with the increase of steam pressure. The third type, double
injectors, are those in which the delivery from one injector is
made the supply of a second, and they will handle water at a
somewhat higher temperature than single ones with fixed
nozzles. The double injector makes use of two sets of nozzles,
the “<em>lifter</em>” and “<em>forcer</em>.” The lifter draws the water from the
reservoir and delivers it to the forcer, which sends it into the
boiler. All double injectors have fixed nozzles.</p>

<p>The action of the injector is as follows: Steam being turned
on, it rushes with great velocity through the steam nozzle into
and through the combining tube. This action causes air to
flow from the suction pipe, which is connected to the combining
tube, with the result that more or less vacuum is formed,
thus inducing a flow of water.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—<em>The motive force of the injector is found in the heat received
from the steam.</em> The steam is condensed and surrenders its latent heat and
some of its sensible heat. The energy so given up by each pound of steam
amounts to about 900 thermal units, each of which is equivalent to a mechanical
force of 778 foot pounds. This would be sufficient to raise a great many
pounds of water against a very great pressure could it be so applied, but a
large portion of it is used simply to heat the water raised by the injector.
The above explanation will apply to every injector in the market, but ingenious
modifications of the principles of construction have been devised in
order to meet a variety of requirements.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_515">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>After the water commences to flow into the injector it receives
motion from the jet of steam; it absorbs heat from the
steam and finally condenses it, and thereafter moves on through
the forcer tube simply as a stream of water, at a low velocity
compared with that of the steam. At the beginning of the
forcer tube, it is subjected only to atmospheric pressure, but
from this point the pressure increases and the water moves
forward under a diminished velocity.</p>

<p>That the condensation of the steam is necessary to complete
the process will be evident, for if the steam were not condensed
in the combining chamber, it would remain a light elastic body
and, though moving at high speed, would have a low degree
of energy.</p>

<p>Some injectors are given special names by their makers,
such as ejectors and inspirators, but the term injectors is the
general name covering the principle upon which all these devices
act. The exhaust steam injector is a type different from any
of the above-named, in that it uses the exhaust steam from a
non-condensing engine. Exhaust steam represents fourteen and
seven-tenths (14.7) pounds of work, and when the steam entering
the injector is condensed the water is forced into the boiler
upon the same general principle as in all injectors.</p>

<p>The injector can be, and frequently is, used as a pump to
raise water from one level to another. It has been used as an
air compressor, exhauster and also for receiving the exhaust
from a steam engine, taking the place, in that case of both condenser
and air pump.</p>

<p>The injector is not an economical device, but it is simple
and convenient; it occupies a very small space, is not expensive
and entirely free from severe strains on its durability;
moreover, where a number of boilers are used in one establishment,
it is very convenient to have the feeding arrangements
separate, so that each boiler may be a complete generating
system in itself and independent of its neighbors.</p>

<p><em>The “Manhattan” automatic injector</em> is shown in perspective
and outline upon page 244. This instrument is made by
Messrs. Schaeffer &amp; Budenberg of New York City.</p>

<p>This injector is designed for portable and semi-portable
engines and boilers, and is also adapted for stationary boilers
<em>requiring no high lift</em>. Its main features are simplicity and
positive automatic action. It works under pressures ranging
from 30 to 150 lbs., either lifting or non-lifting.</p>

<p><em>The Monitor injector</em>, Fig. <a href="#fig_513">513</a>, page 246, was designed
originally for locomotive work. It consists mainly of two parts,
viz., 1, the lifting device which raises the water into the injector
and, 2, the forcing device which “picks up” the water and
causes it to flow into the boiler.</p>

<p><em>The Metropolitan double tube injector</em> is shown in the two
figures on page 248.</p>

<p>These are made by the Hayden &amp; Derby Mfg. Co. This
instrument is of the double-tube design and in that particular
resembles the Korting injector described on page 264. Both
the lifting and forcing, as well as the overflow valves are controlled
by one handle.</p>

<p><em>The Metropolitan single tube injector</em> is represented by the
Figs. <a href="#fig_517">517</a> and <a href="#fig_518">518</a>, page 250. The internal parts of this injector,
as may be seen from the sectional engraving, are stationary.
The steam is regulated by the handle, K, which is attached to
the stem, M; the water supply adjusts itself automatically.</p>

under similar working conditions as represented by the following</p>

<p>The figure below shows how the connections or piping
should be made in attaching the Manhattan and Peerless injectors.</p>

<p>The dotted lines indicating pipe and fittings in connection
with the suction represent the way the water supply is to be
received from a tank located above the level of the injector.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_519">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 519.</span></p></div>

<p>The makers of these two instruments have kindly furnished
the following general rules to govern their connection with
steam supply:</p>

<p>1. <em>Place injector in a horizontal position.</em> (See illustrations
<a href="#fig_512">512</a> and <a href="#fig_514">514</a>.) The flap nozzle must in all cases open upward
in direction of air valve. In taking injectors apart be careful to
replace it in that position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>2. <em>Take steam from the highest part of boiler</em>; never connect
to pipes furnishing steam for other purposes.</p>

<p>3. <em>Have all joints perfectly tight</em>, especially the suction
pipe, as no injector will lift water unless atmospheric air is
excluded.</p>

<p>4. <em>Have all pipes thoroughly cleaned</em> from red or white lead
and scale before the injector is connected; it will save trouble
afterwards.</p>

<p>5. <em>All pipes must be of the same or larger diameter</em> than
the corresponding parts of injector.</p>

<p>6. <em>Avoid all short bends</em>, and have all pipes as short and straight
as practicable.</p>

<p>7. <em>Use a strainer at the end</em> of suction pipe; the holes in the
strainer should be small, but <em>their total area larger</em> than the area
of the supply pipe.</p>

<p>8. <em>Insert stop valves in suction, steam and delivery pipes</em>, to
facilitate disconnection in cleaning injector and check valve in
delivery pipe.</p>

<img src="images/i_p254.jpg" width="350" height="422" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 520-533.</span></p></div>

<p>9. <em>Have valve stems packed well</em>; they often leak.</p>

<p>10. <em>To remove incrustations</em> caused by water containing
lime or other impurities, place parts for a reasonable time in a
bath of mineral oil or diluted muriatic acid consisting of 4 parts
of water to 1 part of acid.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The lettered parts shown above apply to both the “Manhattan”
and the “Peerless” injectors. See page <a href="#Page_252">252</a> for the names of the parts corresponding
with the letters.</p></div>

<p><em>The exhaust steam injector</em> utilizes the escaping vapor from
the engine cylinder, hence the saving in fuel and water is very
marked where certain conditions are favorable.</p>

<p>It condenses by means of the smallest possible quantity of
cold water the largest possible quantity of exhaust steam and
<em>puts it into the boiler without the aid of any other power than the
exhaust steam itself</em>. It can be attached to any class of non-condensing
engine, and its use increases the power both of the
engine and boilers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="figs_534_535">

<p>It is worked by waste steam, just as ordinary injectors are
worked by live steam from the boiler.</p>

<p>The first cost and subsequent wear and tear of pumps are
avoided. The power required to work pumps, of whatever
construction, is saved: the exhaust injector doing the same
work by the condensation of waste steam.</p>

<p>The waste steam, in passing through the injector, heats the
feed-water to a temperature of about 190&deg; F. The condensation
in the injector of so large a quantity of waste steam reduces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
back pressure considerably, and necessarily increases the
power of the engine.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for these injectors to form a vacuum of
a half-inch of mercury within the exhaust pipe, which of course
helps the engine to that extent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_536">
<img src="images/i_p256.jpg" width="277" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 536.</span>—See page <a href="#Page_260">260</a>.</p></div>

<p>These injectors work with great success on stationary engines
and boilers, also on steamers, tugs, dredges, etc., as their
operation during the roughest weather is not affected by the
motion of the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p><em>The high pressure</em> exhaust steam injector is shown in Figs. <a href="#figs_537_538">537</a>
and <a href="#figs_537_538">538</a>—the last being an outline exhibiting the internal arrangement
of the instrument: these injectors are made to work at
all pressures up to and not exceeding 150 lbs. to the square inch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="figs_537_538">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 537 and 538.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The high pressure exhaust steam injector</em> is worked <em>by waste
steam up to 75 lbs. pressure only</em>, and a little live steam is introduced
at the top of the injector to force water against
pressures higher than 75 lbs. It will be noticed from sectional
cut that <em>the live steam does not come in contact with the water
until after the exhaust steam has been condensed and has done
its work</em>. The <em>exhaust steam alone</em> gives an impetus to the
water equal to 75 lbs.; it also <em>heats</em> it up to about 190&deg; F. Its
advantages are the same as those of the plain exhaust injector,
the heat of the small jet of live steam which is used to overcome
the excessive pressure being brought back into the boiler.</p>

<p>It raises the temperature of feed-water up to 90&deg; Fahr. if
working against a pressure of 105 lbs., and up to 86&deg; Fahr.
against 120 lbs. boiler pressure. It is regulated in the same
manner as the plain exhaust steam injector.</p>

<p>It is not necessary <em>to use live steam while working against
any pressure below 75 lbs., when exhaust steam alone will suffice</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_539">539</a> represents the piping of the high pressure exhaust
steam injector, the operation of which is described in the following
paragraphs:</p>

<p><em>This injector can be worked under various conditions.</em></p>

<p>1. If boiler pressure does not exceed 75 lbs. per square inch,
exhaust steam only is required. In this case steam is admitted
by valve A.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_539">
<img src="images/i_p258.jpg" width="305" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 539.</span></p></div>

<p>2. For pressures exceeding 75 lbs. exhaust steam is admitted
as before, also a little live steam, slowly, by valve C.</p>

<p>3. If engine is not running, live steam is gradually admitted
by valve B, so that it may expand in pipe F. In case of high
boiler pressure additional live steam is introduced by valve C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p><em>To start this injector.</em></p>

<p>1. Open steam valves as described.</p>

<p>2. Then open water valve.</p>

<p>3. Regulate water valve, and, if necessary, screw up or down
nut R at the lower end of injector until overflow ceases.</p>

<p>If desired, <em>a gauge indicating both pressure and vacuum</em> (a
compound gauge) can be furnished with exhaust steam injectors.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 540 and 541.</p></div>

<p>The accompanying Figs. <a href="#figs_540_541">540</a> and <a href="#figs_540_541">541</a> represent an ejector
with a foot strainer. The table, page <a href="#Page_259">259</a>, gives an idea of its
pipe sizes and capacities.</p>

<p><em>Application of ejectors.</em> The Fig. <a href="#fig_536">536</a>, page 256, shows two
ejectors applied in different ways. One is mounted <em>to lift and force
water</em>, and the other <em>to force only</em>; the latter is submerged in the
water to be elevated, and placed in a vertical position to reduce the
condensation of operating steam to a minimum. In both of these examples
of the use of the device it will be noted a strainer is attached to the
suction pipe. The arrows show the direction of the flow of both the
steam and water.</p>

<p>Certain ejectors will not work well when the steam pressure is too
high. In order to work at all the steam must condense as it flows
into the combining tube. Therefore, when the steam pressure is too
high, and the heat is very great, it is difficult to effect complete
condensation; so that for high pressure steam good results can only be
obtained with cool water. It would be well when the feed water is too
warm to permit the ejector to work right, to reduce the pressure, and
consequently the temperature of the steam supply, as low pressure steam
condenses quickly, and therefore can be employed with better results
than high pressure steam.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—This instrument is marketed as “Van Duzen’s steam jet pump”
(Cincinnati, Ohio), and credit should be given the makers for the useful
table on page 259.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p><em>For high elevations</em> and high temperature of liquids, ejectors
should be submerged from three to six feet; the suction pipe
should always be provided with a strainer and the makers of
the instruments recommend the placing of a check valve in the
force pipe to facilitate the cleaning of the suction pipe by
steam, when made necessary through the raising of impure substances.</p>

<p><em>To start the ejector</em> open the steam valve slowly until the
suction works satisfactorily, <em>when full amount of steam should
be quickly admitted</em>.</p>

<p><em>A double tube ejector</em> is represented in Fig. <a href="#fig_542">542</a>. This is
calculated to use steam economically by reason of its having two tubes,
besides it is well made and properly proportioned to raise water to
high elevations.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_543">543</a> is a cheaper form of apparatus and is designed to elevate
water to very moderate heights and where a saving of steam is not of so
much consequence as in localities where the price of coal is high.</p>

<p><em>The jet pump</em> presented in Fig. <a href="#fig_544">544</a> is another compact form of
this style of ejector and is adapted for its own particular class of
work which is but little known to those unaccustomed to use these
appliances.</p>

<p>When working either an injector or ejector from a long lift
or with a long pull through horizontal piping, it takes several
minutes to exhaust the air from the pipe when steam is turned
on, resulting in a considerable waste of steam each time the
injector is started. This waste can be done away with by the
use of a foot valve.</p>

<p><em>Universal double-tube injector</em> (original Korting injector).
This instrument is the combination of two jets (see Figs. <a href="#fig_545">545</a>
and <a href="#fig_546">546</a>); it is proportioned for extreme temperature and for
quick and strong action, which includes maximum high suction.
<em>The discharge is into the upper jet</em>, where the water receives
the additional strong impulse to carry it into the boiler. <em>The
pressure and volume from the lower jet corresponds to the steam
pressure</em>, and this is as it should be to answer the requirements
of the upper or forcing jet. The varying volume insures the
proper working at high steam pressure as well as at low, and
an increased pressure admits of increased high temperature.</p>

<p>The action of the injector is thus explained; its favorable
operation is due to the double-tube principle; the pieces composing
the Korting injector are shown in the numbered cuts,
page 263, and <em>the names of the parts</em> are given below.</p>

<h3>THE PULSOMETER.</h3></div>

<p><em>The original pulsometer</em> was an instrument called by that
name for measuring the force and frequency of the pulse; it
was invented in 1626 by Santovio of Padua, Italy. The term
has been largely applied to <em>a form of vacuum pump</em>, soon hereafter
to be described; this has a pulsative action—like a heart
beat. The pulsometer, <em>the aqua-thruster</em>, <em>the pulsator</em>, and
other regular <em>double acting two oval reservoirs</em> (one filling while
the other is discharging) <em>automatic condensing steam vacuum
pumps</em> are all patterned after the Thomas Savery pump shown
in Fig. <a href="#fig_552">552</a>; this was patented in England in 1698. It is thus
described:</p>

<p>“The upper end of the suction pipe shown at the mouth
of the pit consists of two branches, which are connected to
similar branches on the lower part of the forcing pipe N. The
suction valves are at B A and the forcing ones at E F, all
opening upwards. Between these valves two short curved
tubes connect the bottoms of the receiver I M with the branches,
as represented, and two other bent tubes, P Q, unite the top
of the receivers with the boiler H. On top of this boiler, and
forming a part of it, is a stout round plate, having two openings
of the same size as the bore of the tubes last mentioned. In
these openings the two steam tubes P Q terminate. Between
the openings, and on the under side of the plate, is a movable
disk, which by a short arm is connected to an axle and moved
by the long lever shown on the top of the boiler; so that by
moving this lever the disk can be made to open or close either
opening, so as to admit or exclude steam from the receivers,
and answering every purpose of a three-way cock.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_553">
<img src="images/i_p270.jpg" width="218" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 553.</span></p></div>

<p>“The face of the disk is ground smooth, so as to fit close
to the under side of the plate, against which it is pressed by
the steam. The perpendicular axle by which the disk is turned
passes through the plate, and the opening is made tight by a
stuffing-box. (The plate and movable disk are represented in
the small figure at the top, one of the openings, Q, being covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
by the disk and the other, P, exposed.) A small cistern,
U, is placed over the receivers, and kept supplied with cold
water from the forcing pipe by means of a ball cock, viz.: a
cock that is opened and shut by a ball floating in the cistern.
From the bottom of this cistern a short pipe, T, proceeds; and
to it is connected, by a swivel joint or stuffing-box, another one at
right angles. This pipe furnishes water to condense the steam in the
receivers, over both of which it can be moved by the rod attached to
the plug of the cock as shown in the figure. The upper cistern denotes
the place where the water raised by the engine is to be discharged.</p>

<p>“A communication is made between the boilers by a syphon or bent
tube, R, whose legs extend nearly to the bottom of the boilers. In the
leg within the small boiler is a valve opening upwards, which permits
the water of G to pass into H, but prevents any returning from the
latter. When the attendant wishes to inject into H a fresh supply of
water, he increases the little fire kept up under the boiler G (which
is always kept supplied with water by the pipe S), and as soon as the
liquid boils and the force of the steam exceeds that in H, the contents
of G, both steam and hot water, are forced through the valve; and thus
H is kept supplied without the action of the machine being stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>“The cock on the pipe S is then opened, the small boiler
again charged, and the water becomes gradually heated; so
that by the time it is wanted in the other boiler, a small addition
to the fuel quickly raises its temperature, and it is again
forced in as before. The quantity of water in the boilers was
ascertained by <em>gauge cocks</em>. These were inserted at the top
(see figure) and pipes soldered to them descended to different
depths.”</p>

<p><em>The modern pulsometer</em> is a low-service pump, and is not
recommended for duties exceeding about eighty feet total
vertical service. With this limitation, its uses are many and
various and for some purposes it is particularly adapted. Years
of practical work with the pulsometer, under widely different
conditions, have demonstrated the merits claimed for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_555">

<p>Its advantages are: 1. Its low cost, as it does not require an
engine or other machinery to operate it. <em>A steam pipe connecting
it with the boiler</em> that is to furnish steam supply is all that
is necessary, and after the pump is once adjusted, it will always
be in order with free power when the steam is turned on. 2.
It is absolutely noiseless in its operation; the slight click of the
steam ball-valve in the neck-piece, as it changes its position, <em>is
the only evidence that it is working</em>. 3. <em>In its capability of
operation while in suspension</em>, and of being lowered or raised
and swung about without at all interfering with its working.</p>

<p>The pulsometer does not <em>require oil</em>, having no pistons,
glands, stuffing-boxes, eccentrics, beams, levers, supplementary
valves, complicated mechanism, etc., which need attention and
adjustment.</p>

<p>The Pulsometer Steam Pump Co., New York, makers of
the pump and owners of the word-symbol, “Pulsometer,” emphasize
the importance of its proper installation, and ask that
the questions given in the note below be answered when suggestions
relative to the placing of the pump are desired.</p>

<p><em>The body of the pulsometer</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_555">555</a>, and a
<em>sectional view</em> in Fig. <a href="#fig_556">556</a>. It is a single casting consisting of
two bottle-shaped chambers, <em>A, A</em>, placed side by side. These
are called <em>working chambers</em>. They taper toward each other
at their upper halves and meet at their upper ends at a point
at which is situated the <em>steam valve-ball, C</em>. This oscillates with
a slight rolling motion between <em>the seats</em>, with which it makes
a steam tight joint, formed at the upper entrance to each of
the working chambers, <em>A, A</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—For what purpose is the pump to be used? How many gallons
per minute or hour are to be pumped? Is the liquid hot, cold, clear or
gritty—fresh, salt, alkaline or acidulous? What will be the required vertical
height of delivery? What will be the horizontal length of delivery? What
will be the required vertical height of suction? What will be the horizontal
length of suction? Does the level of the liquid vary? If so, how much?
How many bends or elbows will there be in delivery? How many bends or
elbows will there be in suction? What horse-power is the boiler? What is
the average steam pressure at the boiler?</p>

<p>A rough sketch showing how and where it is desired to place the pump
will be of considerable assistance in furnishing information.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<p>The portion, <em>B</em>, of the pump, containing the steam ball-valve,
<em>C</em>, is called <em>the neck-piece</em>, and is a separate casting bolted
to the main body of the pump, so that it can be readily removed
for renewal when necessary. To the top of this neck-piece,
<em>B, the neck-cap</em> is bolted, into which the steam supply
pipe is screwed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_556">
<img src="images/i_p274.jpg" width="262" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 556.</span></p></div>

<p>The openings communicating between the chambers, <em>A, A</em>,
and the induction, or <em>foot-valve chamber, D</em>, are covered by
suitable valves, <em>E, E</em>, called <em>suction valves</em>, the valve seats, <em>F,
F</em>, and <em>valve guards, I, I</em>, which latter prevent the valves from
opening too far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>A third chamber, <em>J</em>, called <em>the vacuum chamber</em>, is situated
behind the chambers, <em>A, A</em>, at their lower halves, and between
them at their upper, or tapering halves, and communicates with
them through the round opening in the induction, or foot-valve
chamber, <em>D</em>.</p>

<p>A fourth chamber, called <em>the discharge chamber</em>, situated on
the lower side of the working chambers, <em>A, A</em>, opposite to the
vacuum chamber, <em>J</em>, and represented by the dotted lines in the
sectional view communicates with each of the working chambers,
<em>A, A</em>, by passages at the lower half of its intersection with
these chambers. This discharge chamber contains <em>the discharge
valves, E, E</em>, their valve seats, <em>G, G</em>, and the valve guards, <em>I, I</em>,
which cover the passages leading from chambers, <em>A, A</em>.</p>

<p><em>The delivery pipe, H</em>, connects with the discharge opening
in the top of the discharge chamber by means of a flanged
joint.</p>

<p>The induction, or foot-valve chamber, <em>D</em>, contains the valve,
<em>E</em>, its valve seat, <em>F</em>, and the guard, <em>I</em>, which serve the purpose
of holding the charge of water in the pump. The lower end
of this chamber is connected to the suction pipe by a flanged
joint.</p>

<p>Parts, <em>K, K</em>, are <em>oval plates</em> covering the openings through
which the seat, valve and guard are inserted, to their respective
chambers, and are fastened in position by means of clamps and
bolts, <em>N, N</em>. The ends of these clamps fit loosely into suitable
recesses and are thus held in position while the cover plates are
being applied. Another set of similar clamps and bolts serve
in a like manner, to fasten the seats, valves and guards in place.</p>

<p>The object in employing four openings to the pump, instead
of two, is to make it possible and convenient to get at
the interior for examination, and easy to remove all deposit
that may form on the walls of the chambers which could not
be reached otherwise.</p>

<p>Vent plugs are inserted in the cover plates for the purpose
of draining off the water in the pump to prevent freezing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>Near the top of each of the working chambers, <em>A, A</em>, and of the
vacuum chamber, <em>J</em>, is a small tapped hole, into which is screwed
a brass air check-valve, so that its check hangs downward. The air
check-valves in the chambers, <em>A, A</em>, allow <em>a small quantity of air
to be automatically admitted above the water</em>, and ahead of the steam,
separating the steam and the water upon their first entrance, thus
preventing condensation, and forming an <em>air piston</em>, which is always
new and tight. The <em>air check-valve</em> in the chamber, <em>J</em>, likewise
admits air automatically, which serves to cushion the ram action of
water consequent upon the alternate filling of the chambers, <em>A, A</em>.</p>

<p><em>The action of the pulsometer is as follows</em>: When all chambers
and pipes are empty, the air check-valves have to be closed, and the
globe valve opened for an instant; then steam will enter one of the
chambers, expel the air, and condense, forming a vacuum. This operation
being repeated several times, both chambers will be filled with
water through the induction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277"
id="Page_277">277</a></span> pipe. Each air-valve in the chambers
must now be opened a little, to secure a regular and successive action,
which will be recognized by the regular pulsations and smooth working
of the steam-ball without rattling.</p>

<p>Steam, being now admitted, continuously enters the chamber
not closed by the ball, and forces out the water through the
discharge-valves, until its surface is lowered below the
discharge-orifice. At that instant the steam begins to escape into the
discharge-pipe, and condenses; thus a partial vacuum is formed in the
chamber. The water in the other chamber now presses the ball, which
rolls over and closes the first chamber, when water enters through the
induction-valves to fill the vacuum. This operation alternately changes
from one chamber to the other.</p>

<p><em>The principal parts of a pulsometer</em> are shown in the seven figures
upon this and the preceding pages.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_557">557</a> represents the regular flat valve, seat and guard,
Fig. <a href="#fig_558">558</a> the guard detached, while Fig. <a href="#fig_559">559</a> is the plain flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
rubber valve. The valve seat for clean water is shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig_560">560</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_564">
<img src="images/i_p278.jpg" width="499" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 564.</span></p></div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—For emptying vats or tanks and for distributing the liquors from
one tank to another or throughout the building, the pulsometer arranged as
per accompanying ills., Fig. <a href="#fig_564">564</a>, will be found to be of great usefulness.
At convenient intervals along the steam main and discharge main, suitable
couplings can be provided for quickly attaching a short section of steam
and discharge hose, as the pump, suspended from a trolley, is moved along
from tank to tank.</p></div>

<p>In pumping muddy water or other liquids containing matter
which would obstruct the valve seat shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_560">560</a> the ball
valve, Fig. <a href="#fig_561">561</a>, is used. The engraving illustrates this valve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
with its guard and seat. Fig. <a href="#fig_562">562</a> represents the neck-piece
containing the ball steam valve, while Fig. <a href="#fig_563">563</a> conveys the
idea of the manner of covering the ball by the cap after which
the neck-piece is ready to be bolted to the top of pump.</p>

<p><em>The Maslin automatic steam vacuum pump</em> is presented in
Fig. <a href="#fig_554">554</a>, page 271. Its principle is identical with that of the
pulsometer but it differs somewhat in detail, as for example,
the three valves with their seats, H, H, H, are introduced
through one opening or hand-hole. The two suction valves,
E, E, are secured by one bolt, I, likewise the two discharge
valves, K. The combination of the foot valve, G, in the pump
requires no bolting on being held by the bolt, I.</p>

<p>The plain cover is of such a shape that no nuts are removed
to afford access to the valves; all that is necessary is to slack
up one nut and swing the cover to one side.</p>

<p>The valves are of very thick rubber but are cut away near
the center so that they readily yield to the pressure underneath,
giving a full area of opening. The two air valves are
attached at the end of the neck-piece.</p>

<p>There are no projecting set screws or bolts running through
the main body of this pump attended as they often are with
more or less leakage. A hook is provided to suspend the pump
in a shaft or over sewer work. The two drip cocks at the bottom
drain the chambers when necessary to prevent freezing, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—“One of the most important points to be attended to, and which
is so often overlooked, is that <em>dry</em> steam should be supplied to the pulsometer.
Take steam from the highest part of the boiler. Do not connect
steam pipe to a pipe furnishing steam for any other purpose; but if you
have to take steam from a large steam pipe, tap it on the upper side so as to
avoid the drip caused by condensation in the large pipe. When the boiler
is some distance from the pulsometer the steam pipe to it should be larger
than is needed at the pulsometer, and be protected by some non-conducting
substance. Reduce to size required at the pulsometer and provide a pet cock
to draw off condensed steam before starting it. Be sure and blow out steam
pipe thoroughly before connecting the pulsometer so as to remove any dirt,
rust or scale that may have accumulated in pipes, also remove all burrs on
ends of the pipe caused by cutting, and which in most cases greatly decreases
their capacity and effectiveness.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p>The illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig_565">565</a>, represents the pulsometer and
boiler in portable form. This will be found a very convenient
outfit for certain classes of irrigation, and for pumping out
flooded cellars, excavations, etc. Also for sewer-trench excavating
operations, where water accumulates at different
sections of the work, and where it is desired to move the
pump and boiler frequently.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_565">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 565.</span></p></div>

<p>The pump is suspended from a strong framework and is controlled by
a chain hoist, by means of which it can readily be lowered or raised.
When the trench or ditch is too deep for the pulsometer to lift the
water to the surface of the ground by suction, the truck can be run
out on planks over the ditch, when the pump can be lowered to the
necessary suction distance from the water. Suitable lengths of steam
hose, with universal couplings, suction hose, also suitable lengths
of light flanged galvanized pipe for the discharge, which can be
readily connected may be carried on the truck, proper brackets being
provided for their reception. As the suction and discharge connections
are flanged, they can be connected or disconnected in a few minutes;
provision is made to prevent the pump from swinging.</p>

<h3>PUMP SPEED GOVERNORS.</h3></div>

<p>The speed at which a pump is operated is a matter of more
or less importance, according to its widely varying conditions.
In all calculations regarding the capacity of a pump the
regularity with which it makes its “stroke” is taken into consideration;
the uniformity of the supply of water to a boiler is
always a subject of anxiety to the attendant. The capacity of
a pump is usually determined by its number of strokes in a
given time, hence the need of a pump regulator or governor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_566">
<img src="images/i_p283.jpg" width="450" height="421" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 566.</span></p></div>

<p>The governor is not only intended to maintain a uniform
water pressure in the mains, but to prevent the pump from
racing whenever a greater quantity of water is demanded than
the pump is capable of delivering, as in the case of bursted
mains or hose, or any other contingency whereby the pressure
upon the discharge pipe is suddenly relieved.</p>

<p>Examples of pump governors or regulators follow.—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p><em>The Mason Pump Governor.</em> This pump governor, shown
in Figs. <a href="#fig_566">566</a> and <a href="#fig_567">567</a>, is attached directly to the rock arm
of the pump, and operates a balance valve placed in the steam
pipe, thereby exactly weighing the pressure of steam to the
needs of the pump. As all the working parts are immersed in
oil, the wear is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_567">
<img src="images/i_p284.jpg" width="263" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 567.</span></p></div>

<p>The Mason governor consists mainly of a cylindrical shell,
or reservoir, as shown in sectional view, filled with oil or
glycerine. The plunger, <em>A</em>, is connected with the arm, <em>I</em>, to
some reciprocating part of the pump and works simultaneously
with the strokes of the pump, thereby drawing the oil up
through the check valve, <em>DD</em>, into the chambers, <em>JJ</em>, whence
it is forced alternately through the passages, <em>BB</em>, through another
set of check valves into the pressure chamber, <em>EE</em>. The
oil then runs through the orifice, <em>C</em>, the size of which is controlled
by a key inserted at, <em>N</em>, into the lower chamber, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
re-pumped as before. In case the pump or engine works more
rapidly than is intended the oil is pumped into the chamber,
<em>EE</em>, faster than it can escape through the outlet at, <em>C</em>, and the
piston, <em>GG</em>, is forced upward, raising the lever, <em>L</em>, with its
weight, and throttling the steam. In case the pump runs more
slowly than was intended, a reverse action takes place, the
weight on the end of the lever, <em>L</em>, forces the piston, <em>GG</em>, down
and more steam is admitted. As the orifice at, <em>C</em>, can be increased
or diminished by adjusting the screw at, <em>N</em>, the governor
can be set within reasonable limits to maintain any desired
speed. The piston, <em>GG</em>, fits over the stationary piston, forming
an oil dashpot, thereby preventing dancing of the governor.
This dashpot is fed from the pressure chamber, <em>E</em>, through a
passage which is controlled by an adjusting screw, <em>K</em>, which is
set with a screwdriver, after removing the cap screw, <em>T</em>. It
requires no further attention after being once adjusted.</p>

<p>For duplex pumps up to 2-inch steam pipe, inclusive, this
governor is fitted with a duplex valve, which prevents the
escape of oil from the pressure chamber through the orifice, <em>C</em>,
and thereby prevents the steam valve from opening wide during
the momentary pause of the pump piston.</p>

<p>This governor should be placed on the pump at some point
where the requisite motion can be obtained for operating it,
and also in such a way that a rod can be run from the knuckle
joint on the top lever, <em>I</em>, to the valve in the steam pipe, as
shown in the engraving. Place the valve in the pipe, so that
the stem shall be in a direct line with the knuckle joint on the
lever, and pull out the valve stem to its full extent. With the
ball on the governor in its lowest position, connect the valve
rod to the lever. The governor is then ready to be filled with
oil. Remove the plug on top of the gauge glass, and fill the
governor about half full with a good, clean, light grade of
mineral oil. The governor is then ready to work.</p>

<p>Start the pump at about its maximum speed; place the
key in the keyhole on the side of the governor and turn to
the right until the speed of the pump has diminished slightly.
Open the throttle valve wide, and the pump will be under full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
control of the governor. Should there be much dancing or
fluctuation of the ball, remove the screw, <em>T</em>, insert a small
screwdriver, and screw the adjusting screw in, at <em>K</em>, until the
irregular motion ceases. After the governor has run a little
while, it will be found that the oil in the glass gauge has dropped
considerably. It should then be refilled, so that the glass will
be about half full when the governor is at work. Under no
circumstances should the gauge be full, as too much oil will
prevent the ball from coming down and opening the valve
when the steam pressure falls. As there is no glass pressure
upon the glass gauge the governor may be filled while in motion
by removing the plug on the top of the gauge.</p>

<p><em>The Mason elevator pump pressure regulator.</em> This regulator,
illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig_569">569</a>, is designed for use in connection
with the larger sizes of steam pumps operating hydraulic
elevators. Its important feature is in operating on the slightest
change of pressure opening to its fullest extent and closing
the steam valve promptly and positively.</p>

<p>Referring to sectional view, Fig. <a href="#fig_570">570</a>, the operation of this
valve is as follows: steam from the boiler enters the regulator at
the inlet, indicated by the arrows and passes through into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
pump, which continues in motion until the required water pressure
is obtained in the system, and through a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch pipe connected
to, <em>A</em>, acts upon the diaphragm, <em>B</em>. This diaphragm is
raised by the excess water pressure, and carries with it the
weighted lever, <em>F</em>, opens the auxiliary valve, <em>D</em>, and admits the
water pressure from the connection, <em>E</em>, to the top of the piston,
at the same time opens the exhaust ports under the piston,
and allows the water under the piston to escape into the drip
pipe, thereby pushing the piston down, closes the steam valve
and stops the pump.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_569">
<img src="images/i_p287.jpg" width="367" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 569.</span></p></div>

<p>As soon as the pressure in the system is slightly reduced,
the lever, <em>F</em>, on account of this reduced pressure under the
diaphragm, is forced down by the weight, carries with it the
auxiliary valve, <em>D</em>, opens the exhaust to the top of the piston,
and also admits water pressure under the piston, which is forced
up and opens the steam valve, and starts the pump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>The speed controlling device of the style A governor shown
in Fig. <a href="#fig_571">571</a> is simple and can be so set as to prevent the
pump from racing, regardless of the drop in water pressure.
Surrounding the upper end of the valve stem is a coiled spring,
which acts as a cushion for the valve and stem, and by the use
of a spring, the stem can be quite small thus reducing the
friction in the stuffing-box to a minimum. The tension of this
spring is sufficient to firmly seat the valve, but if excessive
pressure is exerted on the piston, which is often the case when
two or more pumps are connected to the same mains, the
spring will be compressed and will allow the sleeve to slide
down on the stem, thus relieving the valve of the increased
strain, which would be liable to injure it or buckle the stem.</p>

<p>The regulating hand wheel remains cool, and can be manipulated
without injury to the hands. The regulation is very simple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
and is quickly adjusted by simply turning the wheel to the
right or left, to increase or decrease the pressure. No locking
device is necessary, as the wheel will remain in any set position.</p>

<p>The cylinder will not become coated with lime, but will retain
its smooth surface over which the piston travels, insuring
free action, with no leakage around the piston. The drip is
located at the extreme upper travel of the piston, so as to retain
sufficient water in the cylinder to prevent any air from
coming in contact with leather piston packing. This arrangement
insures a tight piston as the leather packing will remain
soft and pliable and at the same time the water serves as a
lubricant for the interior of the cylinder.</p>

<p>The hand wheel can be placed in different positions and all
that is necessary to make the change is to take out the bolts
and move the regulating hand wheel to the desired position.
By this arrangement the engineer can set the hand wheel regardless
of the arrangement of the steam piping.</p>

<p>All sizes, including 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch and smaller, are made as shown
in style B, Fig. <a href="#fig_572">572</a>, and are not provided with an automatic
speed controlling device. This style is made especially
for boiler feed pumps and for supply pumps for the street
system of hot water heating. They are also fitted with a special
valve for pumps working under very high steam and low water
pressure.</p>

<p>The finished parts of these Carr steam pump governors,
Figs. <a href="#fig_571">571</a> and <a href="#fig_572">572</a>, are nickel plated.</p>

<p>The valves and seats in these governors and regulators
are renewable, Fig. <a href="#fig_573">573</a>. The tools necessary to remove the
seats are a wrench and a flat piece of iron wide enough to span
the lugs on top of the upper seat. The upper seat is threaded
and screwed into the upper opening in the valve chamber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
The lower valve seat is fitted into the lower opening, a steam-tight
fit, but is free to move sufficiently to compensate for the
expansion of the valve.</p>

<p>The bridges, which unite the valve seats, contain about
an equal quantity of metal, and are of equal length with the
post that binds the valve discs, thus compensating for the expansion
and contraction of the metal and insuring a perfectly
tight valve, regardless of the temperature of the steam.</p>

<p><em>The Holyoke Improved Speed Governor for water wheels</em> is
shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_574">574</a> and <a href="#fig_575">575</a>. The following is a description of
the two figures where the same letters are used to designate
the parts appearing in both illustrations:</p>

<p>The pulley, A, is the receiving pulley, and is designed to run at
400 revolutions per minute, receiving its power from the water-wheel
shaft, or countershaft belted from the same.</p>

<p>Contained in the pulley, A, are the two governing weights, BB, of
which the centrifugal forces are overcome by the springs, CC. The
varying motions of the governing weights, BB, are transmitted through
racks and pinions in the hub of pulley, A, to levers, K and L, which
operate the valve, N, admitting water under a light pressure to the
cylinder, O. The water is admitted to the cylinder, O, through ports at
either end, causing the piston to move forward or backward, governed by
the movement of the governing weights, BB.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 575.</span></p></div>

<p>The pulley, A, is keyed to the main shaft, and at the opposite
end is keyed a bevel pinion running in mesh with a bevel
gear on either side, all of which are contained in the gear-case,
P. These gears cause the clutch discs, D, to run in opposite
directions. In each disc is a clutch, E, keyed to a shaft, transmitting
power to the pinion, S, running in mesh with the spur
gear, R, which is loose on the shaft, J, and transmits its power
through the pin clutch, T, to gate shaft, J. The gate shaft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
J, is connected by a pair of bevel gears to the shaft and hand
wheel, Q.</p>

<p>The motion of the piston rod, I, caused by the movement of
piston in cylinder, O, is carried by the lever, G, to the clutch
shaft, F, by means of the pivoted nut at V. The clutch shaft,
F, operates either clutch, E, corresponding to the movement
of the governing weights, BB, caused by the variation in speed.
From the clutch thus engaged, the power is carried by the
clutch shaft, F, through the gears, S and R, and the pin clutch,
T, to the gate shaft, J.</p>

<p>The makers of the machine here described, say: “In the year 1902 our
attention was called to a new governor invented by <em>Nathaniel Lombard</em>, and
after finding by actual tests that this governor possessed advantages over all
others then in use, we were induced to make arrangements for its manufacture
and sale. Two years have been spent in improving and perfecting this
machine, hence the name ‘The Improved Governor.’”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p>The governor is provided with a steadying device operated
by the chain, H. The gate shaft, J, is designed to make four,
six or eight turns to open the gate, four being the regular
number.</p>

<p>The receiving pulley and governor gate shaft may revolve
in either direction, as desired.</p>

<p>The receiving pulley is designed to run at 400 revolutions
per minute, and is driven by a 4-inch double belt.</p>

<p>The governor gate shaft may be arranged to open the gates
in four, six or eight turns, and may be extended on either or
both sides of the governor to meet the necessary requirements.</p>

<p>The governor is capable of exerting a pressure ranging from
25,000 to 50,000 foot pounds on the governor gate shaft.</p>

<p>The advantages claimed for this improvement on <em>the
Lombard governor</em> are thus stated:</p>

<p>1. It requires only a light water pressure to handle the
heaviest gates.</p>

<p>2. It is simple in construction. All parts are easy of access.</p>

<p>3. There are no pumps working under high pressure.</p>

<p>4. There are no dash pots to get out of adjustment, due
to the change in temperature of oil, etc.</p>

<p>5. There is but one belt on this machine.</p>

<p>6. All parts which are constantly in motion are equipped
with ring-oiling bearings.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_576">576</a> is an illustration of the mechanism necessary to
raise and lower <em>the head gates</em> which are used to admit and
regulate, also to shut off the water supply from pond or lake
<em>to the flume conveying it to the wheel</em>. In this case there are
two head gates having racks upon the upright timbers connecting
with the gates. Two shrouded pinions engage these racks,
which are keyed upon a shaft having a large spur wheel at its
end, as represented. A pinion upon a second shaft engages
this spur wheel which in turn has also a spur wheel which
engages a pinion upon the crank shaft having two cranks opposite
one another. By means of these cranks with two to four
men upon each crank the gates are operated very satisfactorily.
These shafts and gears are mounted upon heavy cast iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
brackets bolted to the floor. Altogether it forms a very massive
piece of mechanism.</p>

<p><em>The Utility combination pump governor</em> is shown in the
figure below. This mechanism may be bolted on any tank or receiver
where the water level is to be automatically maintained.
It consists of a closed pocket containing a float, A, which rises
and falls with the water level inside the tank.</p>

<p>When the water rises above the desired level the float
opens the throttle valve and starts the pump, and when it subsides
the float falls and shuts off the steam.</p>

<h3>CONDENSING APPARATUS.</h3></div>

<p><em>A condenser</em> is an apparatus, separate from the cylinder, in
which exhaust steam is condensed by the action of cold water;
<em>condensation</em> is the act or process of reducing, <em>by depression
of temperature or increase of pressure</em>, etc., to another
and denser form, as gas to the condition of a liquid or steam
to water. There is an electrical device called “a condenser”
which must not be confounded with the hydraulic apparatus of
the same name; there is also an optical instrument designated
by the same term, which belongs to still another division of
practical science.</p>

<p><em>A vacuum</em> is defined very properly as an empty space; a
space in which there is neither steam, water or air—the absolute
absence of everything. The condenser is the apparatus
by which, through the cooling of the steam by means of cold
water, a vacuum is obtained.</p>

<p><em>The steam after expelling the air from the condenser fills it
with its own volume</em> which is at atmospheric pressure nearly
1700 times that of the same weight of water.</p>

<p>Now when a vessel is filled with steam at atmospheric
pressure, and this steam is cooled by external application of
cold water, it will immediately give up its heat, which will pass
off in the cooling water, and <em>the steam will again appear in a
liquid state</em>, occupying only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1700</sub> part of its original volume.</p>

<p>But if the vessel be perfectly tight and none of the outside
air can enter, the space in the vessel not occupied by the water
contains nothing, as before stated. The air exerting a pressure
of nearly 15 pounds to the square inch of the surface of the
vessel tries to collapse it; now if we take a cylinder fitted with
a piston and connect its closed end to this vessel by means of
a pipe, the atmospheric pressure will push this piston down.
The old low pressure engines were operated almost entirely
upon this principle, the steam only served to push the piston
up and exhaust the air from the cylinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig_578">578</a> is exhibited the effect of jets of water from a
spray nozzle meeting a jet of steam; the latter instead of filling
the space with steam is returned to its original condition of
water and the space as shown becomes a vacuum.</p>

<p>Briefly stated condensation and the production of a vacuum
may be used to advantage in the following ways:</p>

<p>1. By increasing the power without increasing the fuel consumption.</p>

<p>2. By saving fuel without reducing the output of power.</p>

<p>3. By saving the boiler feed water required in proportion to
the saving of fuel.</p>

<p>4. By furnishing boiler
feed water free from lime and
other scaling impurities.</p>

<p>5. By preventing the
noise of the escaping exhaust
steam.</p>

<p>6. By permitting the
boiler pressure to be lowered
ten to twenty pounds without
reducing the power or
the economy of the engine.</p>

<p>The discovery of the advantages
arising from the
condensation of steam by
<em>direct contact with water</em> was
accidental.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_578">
<img src="images/i_p300.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 578.</span></p></div>

<p>In the earliest construction of steam-engines the desired
vacuum was produced by the circulation of water through a
jacket around the cylinder. This was a slow and tedious process,
the engine making only seven or eight strokes per minute.
“An accidental unusual circumstance pointed out the remedy,
and greatly increased the effect. As the engine was at work,
the attendants were one day surprised to see it make several
strokes much quicker than usual; and upon searching for the
cause, they found, says Desaguliers, ‘a hole through the piston
which let the cold water (kept upon the piston to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
entrance of air at the packing) into the space underneath.’
The water falling through the steam condensed it almost instantaneously,
and produced a vacuum with far less water than
when applied to the exterior of the cylinder. This led Newcomen
to remove the outer cylinder, <em>and to insert the lower end
of the water pipe into the bottom of the cylinder</em>, so that on
opening a cock a jet of cold water was projected through the
vapor. This beautiful device is the origin of the injection pipe
with a spray nozzle still used in low-pressure engines.”</p>

<p>The apparatus described above is called the <em>jet-condenser</em>
and is in use up to the present day in various forms. In
the Fig. <a href="#fig_577">577</a>, page 298, the jet is shown at C. It will be
understood that steam enters through the cock D and comes
in contact with a spray of cold water at the bottom, where
it is condensed and passes into the air pump through which
it is discharged.</p>

<p>By this diagram, Fig. <a href="#fig_577">577</a>, may be understood in a simple
yet accurate manner <em>the course of steam from the time it leaves
the boiler until it is discharged from the condenser</em>.</p>

<p>Referring to the upper section of the plate, a sectional view
of a steam cylinder, jet condenser, air pump and exhaust piping
is shown. The high pressure steam “aa” is represented
by dark shading, and the low pressure or expanded steam “bb”
by lighter shading.</p>

<p>The steam enters the side “aa,” is cut off, and expansion
takes place moving the piston in the direction of the arrow to
the end of the stroke. The exhaust valve now opens and the
piston starts to return. The low pressure steam instead of
passing direct to the atmosphere, as is the case of a high
pressure engine, flows into a chamber “C,” and is brought in
contact with a spray of cold water. The heat being absorbed
by the water, the steam is condensed and reduced in volume,
thus forming a vacuum. It is, however, necessary to remove
the water formed by the condensed steam together with the
water admitted to condense the steam, also a small amount of
air and vapor. For this purpose, a pump is required, which is
called the air pump.</p>

<p>Condensers are classified into <em>surface condensers
and jet condensers</em>, both again being
divided into direct connected and indirect connected
condensers.</p>

<p>The surface condenser (see Fig. <a href="#fig_579">579</a>) is mainly
used in marine practice because it gives a better
vacuum, and keeps the condensed steam separate
from the cooling water; it consists of a vessel,
of varied shapes, having a number of brass tubes
passing from head to head. The ends of this vessel
are closed by double heads, the tubes are expanded
into the inner one on one end, while
their other ends pass through stuffing-boxes in the
other inner head.</p>

<p>The “admiralty” or rectangular surface condenser
is represented in Fig. <a href="#fig_579">579</a>. This form occupies
less floor space than the round shell, and
is preferred upon steam yachts and small vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>Steam is condensed on its introduction at the top of the
apparatus where it comes in contact with the cool surfaces of
the tubes. Through these water is circulated by a centrifugal
pump driven usually by a separate engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_582">
<img src="images/i_p304.jpg" width="284" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 582.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The water of condensation</em> leaves the condenser at the bottom
and is drawn off by the vacuum pump. <em>The water from
the circulating pump</em> enters at the bottom right-hand end; following
the direction indicated by the arrows, it flows through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
the lower half of the tubes towards the left whence it returns
through the upper half of the tubes towards the right and
escapes overboard through the water outlet pipe.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the coolest water encounters the
lowest temperature of steam at the bottom, hence the best results
are reached. There is also a baffle plate just above the
upper row of tubes to compel a uniform distribution of exhaust
steam among the tubes, as shown in the engraving.</p>

<p>These tubes are usually small—<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>″
outside diameter—of brass and coated with tin inside and outside to
prevent galvanic action which is liable to attack the brass tubes and
cause them to corrode.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_581">581</a> shows an end view of the right-hand head of the surface
condenser here described.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_583">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 583.</span></p></div>

<p>A single tube is shown in detail in Fig. <a href="#fig_580">580</a>. One end of the tube is
drawn sufficiently thick to chase upon it deep screw threads, while a
slot facilitates its removal by a screw-driving tool. The other end is
packed and held in place by a screw gland, which is also provided with
a slot. In this way the tube is firmly held in one head, and, though
tightly fitted in the other, is free to move longitudinally under the
influence of expansion or contraction, due to the varying heat.</p>

<p>In some cases engineers prefer the ordinary arrangement of screw
glands at both ends of the tubes, with the usual wick packing.</p>

<p>The mechanism illustrated in Figs. <a href="#fig_582">582</a> and <a href="#fig_583">583</a> shows <em>a
combined condenser and feed-water heater</em>. A compact and
efficient method of heating the feed-water from the hot well is
of great importance; this is the case in cold weather when
the circulating water is at a low temperature.</p>

<p><em>The Volz apparatus</em> is a combined condenser and feed-water
heater; the shell or exhaust steam chamber contains a set of
tubes, through which the feed-water passes, while the lower part
contains the condensing tubes, both parts being in proper communication
with their respective water chambers. The heater
tubes being located immediately adjacent to the exhaust inlet,
are exposed to the hottest steam, and the feed-water becomes
nearly as high temperature as that of the vacuum. Pages 304
and 305 show the sectional and outside views. The enclosing
shell containing the combined heater and condenser is a well
ribbed cylindrical iron casting; free and independent access is
provided to either set of tubes by removing corresponding heads.</p>

<p>The illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig_584">584</a>, is a longitudinal section of one side
of the condenser pump, and also a section of the condenser
cone, spray pipe, exhaust elbow and injection elbow. “A” is
the exhaust to which is connected the pipe that conducts to
the apparatus the steam or vapor that is to be condensed. The
injection water is conveyed by a pipe attached to the injection
opening at “B.” “C” is the spray pipe, and has, at its lower
extremity, a number of vertical slits through which the injection
water passes and spreads out into thin sheets.</p>

<p>The spray cone “D” scatters the water passing over it,
and thus ensures a rapid intermixture with the steam. This
spray cone is adjustable by means of a stem passing through
a stuffing-box at the top of the condenser, and is operated by
the handle “E.” The cone should be left far enough down to
pass the quantity of water needed for condensation.</p>

<p><em>All regulation of the injection water must be done by an
injection valve placed in the injection pipe at a convenient point.</em></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The surface condensers, Figs. <a href="#fig_579">579</a>-<a href="#fig_581">581</a>, are made by the Wheeler
Condenser and Engineering Co., New York, as are also the Volz combined
surface condenser and feed water heater, shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_582">582</a> and <a href="#fig_583">583</a>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p><em>The operation of this condensing apparatus is as follows</em>:
steam being admitted to the cylinders “K,” so as to set the
pump in motion, a vacuum is formed in the condenser, the
engine cylinder, the connecting exhaust
pipe, and the injection pipe.
This causes the injection water to
enter through the injection pipe attached
at “B” and spray pipe “C”
into the condenser cone “F.” The
main engine being started, the exhaust
steam enters through the exhaust
pipe at “A,” and, coming in
contact with the cold water, is rapidly
condensed. The velocity of the
steam is communicated to the water,
and the whole passes through the
cone “F” into the pump “G” at
a high velocity, carrying with it, in
a comingled condition the air or
uncondensable vapor which enters the condenser with the
steam. The mingled air and water is discharged by the pump
through the valves and pipe at “J” before sufficient time or
space has been allowed for separation to occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<p><em>The exhaust steam induction condenser</em> is based upon the
same principle heretofore explained under the section relating
to injectors. See Fig. <a href="#fig_585">585</a>.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_585">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 585.</span></p></div>

<p>The exhaust steam enters through the nozzle, A. The injection
water surrounds this nozzle and issues downward through the annular
space between the nozzle and the main casting. The steam meeting the
water is condensed, and by virtue of its weight and of the momentum
which it has acquired in flowing into the vacuum the resulting water
continues downward, its velocity being further increased, and the
column solidified by the contraction of the nozzle shown. The air is
in this way carried along with the water and it is impossible for it
to get back against the rapidly flowing steam in the contracted neck.
The condenser will lift its own water twenty feet or so. When water
can be had under sufficient head to thus feed itself into the system,
and the hot-well can at the same time be so situated as to drain
itself, it makes a remarkably simple and efficient arrangement. In
case the elevation is so great that a pump has to be used to force the
injection, the pump has to do less work than the ordinary air pump, and
its exhaust can be used to heat the feed water.</p>

<p><em>The Bulkley “Injector” condenser</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_586">586</a>, arranged
so that the condensing water is supplied by a pump. The condenser is
connected to a vertical exhaust pipe from the engine, at a height of
about 34 feet above the level of the “hot-well.” An air-tight discharge
pipe extends from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309"
id="Page_309">309</a></span> condenser nearly to the bottom of the
“hot-well,” as shown in the engraving.</p>

<p>The condenser is supplied by a pump as shown, or from a tank, or
from a natural “head” of water; the action is continuous, the water
being delivered into the “hot-well” below. The area of the contracted
“neck” of the condenser is greater than that of the annular water inlet
described above, and the height of the water column overcomes the
pressure of the atmosphere without.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_586">
<img src="images/i_p309.jpg" width="368" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 586.</span></p></div>

<p>The supply pump delivers cool water only, and is therefore but
one-third of the size of the air-pump. The pressure of the atmosphere
elevates the water about 26 feet to the condenser.</p>

<p>The accompanying diagrams, Figs. <a href="#fig_587">587</a> and <a href="#fig_588">588</a>, are worthy
of study. They represent <em>a condenser plant</em> designed by the
Schutte &amp; Koerting Co., Philadelphia, and placed on steam-vessels
plying on fresh water. In these drawings the parts are
designed by descriptive lettering instead the ordinary way of
reference figures; this adds to the convenience of the student
in considering this novel application of the condenser-injector,
the action of which is described in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>For steamers plying on fresh water lakes, bays and rivers it
is unnecessary to go to the expense of installing surface condensers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
such as are used in salt water; keel condensers, however,
are used in both cases.</p>

<p><em>The keel condenser</em> consists of two copper or brass pipes
running parallel and close to the keel, one on each side united
by a return bend at the stern post. The forward ends are connected,
one to the exhaust pipe of the engine while the other
end is attached to the suction of the air pump.</p>

<p>In other cases both forward ends are attached to the exhaust pipe
of the steam engine while the water of condensation is drawn through a
smaller pipe connected with the return bend at the stern post which is
the lowest part of the keel condenser.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_587">587</a> is much used for vessels running in fresh water. The
illustration is a two-thirds midship section of a vessel with pipe
connections to the bilge—bottom injection—side injection into the
centrifugal pump, thence upward through suction pipe into the ejector
condenser where it meets and condenses the exhaust steam from the
engine and so on through the discharge pipe overboard. The plan of
piping with valves, drain pipes and heater are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_588">588</a>.</p>

<p>In case of the failure of any of the details of this mechanism
to perform their respective functions a free exhaust valve and
pipe is provided which may be brought instantly into use. The
discharge pipe has a “kink” in it to form a water seal, as represented
with a plug underneath to drain in case of frost, or
in laying up the vessel in winter. A pipe leads from globe
valve (under discharge elbow) to feed pump for hot water.</p>

<p><em>Condensing Surface Required.</em> In the early days of the surface
condenser it was thought necessary to provide a cooling
surface in the condenser equal to the heating surface in the
boilers, the idea being that it would take as much surface to
transfer the heat from a pound of steam to the cooling water
and condense the steam as it would to transfer the heat from
the hot gases to the water in the boiler and convert it into steam.
The difference in temperature, too, between the hot gases and
the water in the boiler is considerably greater than that between
the steam in the condenser and the cooling water.</p>

<p><em>Steam, however, gives up its heat to a relatively cool surface
much more readily than do the hot furnace gases</em>, and the
positively circulated cooling water takes up that heat and keeps
the temperature of the surface down, while in a boiler the absorption
depends in a great measure upon the ability of the
water by natural circulation to get into contact with the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
and take up the heat by evaporization. It has been found,
therefore, that a much smaller surface will suffice in a condenser
than in the boilers which it serves.</p>

<p>The Wheeler Condenser and Engineering Company, who
make a specialty of surface condensers, say that one square foot
of cooling surface is usually allowed to each 10 pounds of steam
to be condensed per hour, with the condensing water at a
normal temperature not exceeding 75&deg;. This figure seems to
be generally used for average conditions. Special cases require
special treatment.</p>

<p>For service in the tropics the cooling surface should be at
least ten per cent. greater than this estimate. Where there is
an abundance of circulating water the surface may be much
less, as with a keel condenser, where 50 pounds of steam is
sometimes condensed per hour per square foot of surface; or a
water works engine, where all the water pumped is discharged
through the condenser and not appreciably raised in temperature,
probably condensing 20 to 40 pounds of steam per hour
per square foot of surface.</p>

<p>Under the division of this volume devoted to “air and
vacuum pumps,” much information has been given relating to
the principles of the condensation of steam and also some
illustrations of working machines. Still it may be well to say
this, in addition, that—</p>

<p>All questions in regard to a vacuum become plain when we
consider that the atmosphere itself exerts a pressure of nearly
15 pounds, and measure everything from an absolute zero, 15
pounds below the atmospheric pressure. We live at the bottom
of an ocean of air. The winds are its currents; we can
heat it, cool it, breathe and handle it, weigh it, and pump it as
we would water. The depth of this atmospheric ocean cannot
be determined as positively as could one of liquid, for the air
is elastic and expands as the pressure decreases in the upper
layers. Its depth is variously estimated at from 20 to 212 miles.
<em>We can, however, determine very simply how much pressure it
exerts per square inch.</em></p>

<h3>UTILITIES AND ATTACHMENTS.</h3></div>

<p><em>Utility</em> is a Latin word meaning the same as the Saxon
word <em>usefulness</em>, hence a utility is something to be used to advantage.</p>

<p>An <em>attachment</em> is that by which one thing is connected to
another; some adjunct attached to a machine or instrument to
enable it to do a special work; these are too numerous to be
described in this work; moreover their number is being so constantly
added to that it would be vain to make the attempt. A
few examples only follow.</p>

<p><em>The Receiver</em> is one of the most important and useful parts
or connections of a steam pump.</p>

<p>This apparatus, frequently called “Pump and Governor,”
and illustrated in Figs. <a href="#fig_589">589</a>, <a href="#fig_590">590</a> and <a href="#fig_591">591</a>, is designed to automatically
drain heating systems and machines or appliances
used in manufacturing which depend upon a free circulation of
steam for their efficiency. It furthermore is arranged to automatically
pump the water of condensation drained from such
systems back to the boilers without loss of heat.</p>

<p>By this operation it serves a double purpose: first to automatically
relieve the system of the water of condensation constantly
collecting therein, thus insuring a free and unobstructed
circulation, and, incidentally, preventing snapping and hammering
in the piping, which in many cases is due to entrained
water; and second, to automatically deliver this water, which
in many cases is at the boiling point, directly to the boilers
without the intervention of tanks or other devices commonly
used. Not only does it relieve the system of a troublesome
factor, but it introduces a supply of feed water to the boiler at
a temperature impossible otherwise without the use of a special
water heater.</p>

<p>The economy resulting from its use is unquestionable, and
the satisfactory and increasing use of this machine leaves no
doubt as to its efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span></p>

<p>As will be seen by the illustrations, the apparatus consists
of a cylinder or oval closed receiver, which, together with the
pump, is mounted upon and secured to a substantial base, making
the whole machine compact and self-contained.</p>

<p>The automatic action of the pump and its speed are controlled
by a float in the receiver operating directly, without the
use of intervening levers, cranks and stuffing boxes, to open or
close a governor valve in the steam supply pipe to the pump,
thus making the action of the pump conditional upon the rise
and fall of the float in the receiver.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_589">
<img src="images/i_p318.jpg" width="500" height="345" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 589.</span></p></div>

<p>In each of the three receivers shown there is <em>a ball float</em>
which appears through the side of the receiver, Fig. <a href="#fig_590">590</a>; these
depend upon the principle of specific gravity for their operation.
The lever fastened to the ball float operates the throttle
valve of the pump; as the vessel fills with water the float rises
opens the throttle valve, and starts the pump.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig_589">589</a> is shown the Deane automatic duplex steam
pump and <em>receiver</em> fitted with valves for hot water; it is also
provided with three separate inlets for convenience in connecting
the returns.</p>

<p>In placing the apparatus, it is only necessary to so locate it
that all returns will drain naturally towards receiver and that
there are no pockets in the piping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>When it is desired to use the automatic receiver as the sole
means of feeding the boilers, it will be necessary to introduce
a small supply of water from some outside source to equalize
the loss which occurs. It is desirable that this water should
flow into receiver rather than into discharge pipe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_590">

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_590">590</a> shows a Mason steam pump with receiver attached.
This pump is described elsewhere at length. Fig. <a href="#fig_591">591</a> represents
the Worthington duplex steam pump with its specially
designed receiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>ball cock</em> is a faucet which is opened or closed by means
of a ball floating on the surface of the water as it rises and falls
in the vessel.</p>

<p>In the illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig_592">592</a>, to be seen below the principle
of its operation may be discerned. The fall of water in the
tank lowers the float and opens the valve (which has in this
case a rubber seat) and a rise of water in the tank closes the
valve, hence this ball float controls and maintains a constant
water level in the tank.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_592">
<img src="images/i_p320.jpg" width="500" height="246" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 592.</span></p></div>

<p>The float is a hollow ball of copper attached to one end of
a lever while the other end is pivoted by a pin through it and
the side of the shell of the valve. The valve itself is held by
a screw to the lever and resembles very much an inverted lever
safety valve.</p>

<p>This principle of construction and operation is applied to
many devices among which is that described on page 318 relating
to pump receivers.</p>

<p>The apparatus constitutes an automatic arrangement for
keeping the water at a certain height. It is useful in cisterns,
water backs, boilers, etc., where the supply is constant, the
demand intermittent.</p>

<p><em>A tank is an artificial receptacle</em> for liquids, thus: <em>a tank
engine</em> is one which carries the water and fuel it requires, thereby
dispensing with a tender; <em>tank-iron</em> or steel is common plate used
in building tanks. Steel is cheaper than sheet-iron. <em>A cistern is
primarily a natural reservoir</em>—a hollow place containing water; more
commonly an underground reservoir or tank. <em>Closed pressure tanks</em> are
usually cylindrical shells similar to a horizontal steam boiler, having
bumped or rounded heads to save bracing. Closed pressure tanks are
used extensively in connection with hydraulic elevators; the requisite
pressure for these was formerly derived from an open tank installed
upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[

located in the engine room, now very generally takes the place of the
open tank.</p>

<p><em>A closed pressure tank</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_596">596</a> in use with a
hydraulic elevator.</p>

<p><em>A reservoir</em> is a place where water is collected and kept for use
when wanted, so as to supply a fountain, a canal or a city by means of
aqueducts or to drive a mill-wheel or the like.</p>

shown.</p>

<p><em>A ship’s ballast tank</em> is the compartment for water to be pumped in

tanning liquor for leather. Fig. <a href="#fig_594">594</a>.</p>

<p><em>A tub</em> is an open wooden vessel formed with staves, bottom and

This is almost exactly equivalent to a cylinder 7 inches in diameter
and 6 inches in height.</p>

<p><em>The imperial gallon of England</em> contains 277.274 cubic inches, and

<p>The contents of cisterns and tanks are estimated either in
gallons or in cubic feet. <em>The weight of water in any cistern or
tank</em> can be ascertained by multiplying the number of gallons
by the weight of one gallon, which is 8<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> pounds, 8.333. For
instance, taking the largest cistern in the above table containing
3671 gallons: 3671 &times; 8.33 = 30579.43 lbs. (nearly).</p>

<p><em>If the cistern is rectangular</em>, the number of gallons and
weight of water are found by multiplying the dimensions of
the cistern to get the cubical contents. For instance, for a
cistern or tank 96 inches long, 72 inches wide, and 48 inches
deep, the formula would be: 96 &times; 72 &times; 48 = 331,776 cubic inches.</p>

<p>As a gallon contains 231 cubic inches; 331,776 divided by
231 gives 1,436 gallons, which multiplied by 8.33 will give the
weight of water in the cistern. Fig. <a href="#fig_594">594</a>.</p>

<p><em>For round cisterns or tanks</em>, the rule is: Area of bottom on
inside multiplied by the height, equals cubical capacity. For
instance, taking the last tank or cistern in the table: area of
24 inches (diameter) is 452.39, which multiplied by 12 inches
(height) gives 5527.6 cubic inches, and this divided by 231
cubic inches in a gallon gives 23 gallons. Fig. <a href="#fig_595">595</a>.</p>

<p><em>Rule for obtaining the contents of a barrel in gallons.</em> Take
the diameter at the bung, then square it, double it, then add
square of head diameter; multiply this sum by length of cask,
and that product by .2618 which will give volume in cubic
inches; this, divided by 231, will give result in gallons.</p>

<h3>STRAINERS FOR SUCTION PIPES,</h3></div>

<p>It is very desirable to place an efficient strainer on the suction
pipe of a pump where there is the least suspicion that the
water contains any sediment or floating matter.</p>

<p>Several of these useful pump attachments have been already
shown, connected with pumps, in previous sections of this
work, but a few more are here added.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#figs_597_598">597</a> exhibits a cross section of a strainer of large
capacity of long and satisfactory use. It has a semi-cylindrical
vessel located in one side of the side pipe. Holes are drilled
through the flat side extending across the diameter of the side
pipe; any floating matter which will not pass through the
holes collects in this strainer vessel and may be easily removed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="figs_597_598">
<img src="images/i_p325.jpg" width="450" height="387" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 597 and 598.</span></p></div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#figs_597_598">598</a> represents a longitudinal section of this strainer.
The top of the chamber is covered by a bonnet secured by a
claw having one bolt, so that by unscrewing this bolt the claw
and bonnet may be unfastened and the settling chamber with
perforated plate withdrawn.</p>

<p>A suction valve with double strainer is represented by Fig.
<a href="#fig_599">599</a>, in which the outer screen is raised for cleaning. In lowering,
it is guided to its place by the cage around the foot valve
chest, as will be seen in Fig. <a href="#fig_600">600</a>, which is a sectional view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
this same valve. The suction pipe extension enables the pump
to draw water when its surface has fallen below the top of
strainer and also below the foot valves. This is often a great
advantage where water is scarce and every gallon is needed.</p>

<p><em>This foot valve is a “double clack”</em> hinged in the center.
There are no openings or perforations in the bottom plate.
Fig. <a href="#fig_601">601</a> is a very convenient form of strainer for large pipes
and where it is an advantage to have the strainer in the engine-room
or near the pump. This strainer,
like Fig. <a href="#figs_597_598">597</a>, can be lifted out for cleaning
by removing the claw and bonnet.
The chamber may be washed out by
removing the plug at the bottom.</p>

<p>A most convenient vacuum chamber and strainer is represented
in Fig. <a href="#fig_602">602</a>; it is located near the pump. By removing
the suction chamber the basket or strainer may be lifted out by
the handle under the arrow. The outlet is generally attached
directly to the pump. The pump may be charged by removing
the “priming plug” and inserting a hose, with water
turned on.</p>

<p><em>Steam boiler feed water impurities</em> consist mainly of chemical
substances which are unaffected—as may be readily supposed—by
mechanical devices just described; these impurities are largely
invisible being dissolved in the water and hence, also, considering
their variety, are most difficult to contend with. How to
avoid the actual evils arising from the presence of foreign
matter in feed water is of the first importance in steam economy;
enormous losses of money, danger to life and
property are involved in it. It has been said
that there are more millions of treasure to
be made by properly “treating” the water
which enters the steam generators of the
world than can be extracted from its gold
mines.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Strangely, investigation has proved that water of this purity
rapidly corrodes iron, and attacks even pure iron and steel more readily
than “hard” water does, and sometimes gives a great deal of trouble where
the metal is not homogeneous. Marine boilers would be rapidly ruined by
pure distilled water if not previously “scaled” about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> of an inch.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<p>To deal properly with this subject the science of chemistry
must be largely drawn upon; chemically pure water is that
which has no impurities, and may be described as colorless,
tasteless, without smell, transparent, and in a very slight degree
compressible, and, were a quantity evaporated from a perfectly
clean vessel, there would be no solid matter remaining. Now,
in dealing with the impurities inside a boiler, it is to be observed
<em>that in no sense do they change the essential nature of
water itself</em>. The impurities are simply foreign bodies, which
have no legitimate place in the boiler, and are to be expelled
as thoroughly as possible.</p>

<p>The chemical substances to be eliminated are indicated in
the note below. Water, on becoming steam, separates from
the impurities which it may have contained, and these form
sediment and incrustation. This is an important fact.</p>

<p><em>Corrosion</em> is simply rusting or wasting away of the surfaces
of the metals. Incrustation means simply a coating over.</p>

<p>Several approved recipes and “notes” of instruction for removing
sediment and incrustation from steam boilers will be
found near the close of this volume.</p>

<h3>THE WATER METER.</h3></div>

<p>Water meters, or measurers, are constructed upon two general
principles: 1, an arrangement called an “<em>inferential meter</em>”
made to divert a certain proportion of the water passing in the
main pipe and by measuring accurately the small stream diverted,
<em>to infer</em>, or estimate the larger quantity; 2, <em>the positive
meter</em>; rotary piston meters are of the latter class.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_603">
<img src="images/i_p329.jpg" width="431" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 603.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="figs_604_605">
<img src="images/i_p330.jpg" width="600" height="345" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 604, 605.</span></p></div>

<p>The distinctive difference between the two is, that the
positive meter measures water by means of a chamber alternately
filled and emptied. In most of these the flow of water
ceases when, by any derangement, the motion of the piston is
interrupted. But neither the motion nor the stoppage of the
inferential meter has any effect upon the water delivery, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
that at times a large amount of water may pass unrecorded.
Another important mechanical difference is that the motion of
a piston meter should be slow, while that of the inferential
wheel is, and must be, rapid; this has much to do with their
relative durability.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_603">603</a> is a perspective view of the <em>Worthington water
meter</em>, the details of which are shown in the Figs. <a href="#figs_604_605">604</a> and
<a href="#figs_604_605">605</a>, the recording or “dial” mechanism is also shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig_606">606</a>.</p>

<p>The internal arrangement of the meter is shown in longitudinal
section, Fig. <a href="#figs_604_605">604</a>, and the transverse section, Fig. <a href="#figs_604_605">605</a>, on the
opposite page.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_606">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 606.</span></p></div>

<p>The plungers, AA, are closely fitted into parallel rings. The water
passes through the inlet and port I, and is admitted under pressure
into chamber, D, at one end of each plunger alternately, while the
connection is made between the chamber at the other end of the outlet.
Thus, the plunger in moving displaces its volume, discharging it
through its outlet. The arrangement is such that the stroke of the two
plungers alternates, the valve actuated by one admitting pressure to
the other. The plungers are brought to rest at the end of the stroke by
the rubber buffers, EE. One plunger imparts a reciprocating motion to
the lever, F, which operates the counter movement through the spindle
and ratchet gear as shown. Thus, it will be seen that the counter is
arranged to move the dial pointers once for every four strokes or
displacements, and that water cannot pass through the meter without
registration, for, in order to pass through, it must be displaced by
the plungers, and, therefore, recorded by the movement of the lever and
counter mechanism; nor can there be an over-registration, because the
plungers cannot move without displacing the fluid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p><em>To read the dial.</em> The counter usually registers in cubic
feet, one cubic foot being 7.48 gallons U. S. standard. When
desired for special services, counters are furnished reading in
U. S. gallons, Imperial gallons, and Hectolitres. This counter
is read in the same way as the registers of gas meters.</p>

<p>The following example and directions may be of use to
those unacquainted with this method:</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_607">
<img src="images/i_p332.jpg" width="500" height="430" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 607.</span></p></div>

<p>If the pointer is between two figures, the smaller one must
invariably be taken; suppose the pointers of the dial stand, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_606">606</a>; starting at the dial marked 10 cubic feet,
we get the figure 4; from the next marked 100 cubic feet, the
figure 7; from the next marked 1,000 cubic feet, the figure 8,
and from the next marked 10,000 cubic feet, the figure 6; the
reading is 6,874 cubic feet. The pointer on the 100,000 cubic
foot dial being between the 0 and the 1 indicates nothing.
By subtracting the first reading taken from that taken at the
next observation, the consumption of water for the intermediate
time is obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p><em>A steam trap</em> is an apparatus to remove the water of condensation
from steam pipes for heater coils and radiators without
permitting steam to escape; the steam trap is also used to
remove the water of condensation or entrained water caught in
steam separators, located near the steam engine in the connecting
pipes between the engine and boilers.</p>

<p>The problem of saving the water of condensation without
allowing the escape of steam is a difficult one, in view of the
early wear of the valves and the valve seats.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_607">607</a> represents the Anderson improved steam trap.
This trap shows at all times what it is doing by the position of
the water in the glass gauge attached to the side of the trap
and in front. The water of condensation enters at the upper
right-hand side, A, Fig. <a href="#fig_608">608</a>,
where all scale and dirt from
the pipes are caught in the settling
chamber which contains a
strainer. This strainer can be
lifted out with its contents of
dirt and scale and replaced in a
few moments by unscrewing
the plugs, shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_607">607</a>
just above the inlet. The discharge
is connected at the lower left-hand side. The bonnet
which contains the valve float and lever can be removed without
breaking any pipe joints, or the valve and seat may be removed
by simply unscrewing the cap, H, at the lower left-hand side
without disturbing the bonnet at all. It will be understood
that this trap does not dump, but the discharge of water is
regulated by a ball float and valve, hence there are really but
two working parts to this trap, viz.: the ball float and valve.
Water is permitted to pass this trap as fast as it comes along,
and no considerable quantity ever accumulates within this trap
at any one time.</p>

<div class="image-left" id="fig_608">
<img src="images/i_p333.jpg" width="300" height="245" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 608.</span></p></div>

<p>The sectional view, Fig. <a href="#fig_608">608</a>, gives a fair idea of the interior
of this trap, being a longitudinal section on center line. The
by-pass valve, C, so-called, is not a valve, but is simply a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
threaded stem and is used to hold up the float in emptying the
trap. To blow out the trap this by-pass is screwed in as far as
it will go without forcing, same motion as in closing a globe
valve. When the water has been discharged, this by-pass is
unscrewed to its former position, which permits the float to
drop, closing the valve when the reservoir fills with water, to
its normal position.</p>

<p>With three inches of water in the glass the valve is closed
and sealed so that no steam can escape. The dotted line
represents the water level. The sediment chamber, E, prevents
dirt and scales in the pipes from getting into the valve.</p>

<p>The ball float is made of seamless copper with heavy bands
to prevent the ball from collapsing under high pressure. These
traps work on all pressures from 150 pounds pressure down,
and are also made for higher pressures in special cases—will
work against back pressure and with exhaust steam alone—are
made in seven sizes, <em>i.e.</em>, from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch to 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches, inclusive.</p>

<h3>TOOLS.</h3></div>

<p>The implements described hereafter are called “hand-tools”
to distinguish them from machine-tools. <em>A portable tool</em> is a
tool or machine-tool which can be taken from place to place,
for example a riveting machine.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_610">
<img src="images/i_p338_fig_610.jpg" width="129" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 610.</span></p></div>

<p><em>Tool</em>, the word, comes probably from toil, signifying the thing
with which one toils or labors, a hammer, file or wrench; a tool
never ceases to be a tool, <em>i.e.</em>, something which is applied
directly to the work; generally tools in machine practice cut,
abrade, like a file, or strike—as a hammer; a tool is that which
is brought to bear directly on the work; again, it is any implement
used by a craftsman at his work; it is any instrument
employed for performing, or aiding to perform, mechanical
operations by means of striking, penetration, separation, abrasion,
friction, etc.</p>

<p>Again in practical mechanics the word tool has a restrictive
meaning; a single device, as a chisel, crowbar or saw, or a very
simple combination of moving parts, as tongs, shears, pincers,
etc. These latter for manual use, are always called tools,
although embodied in the strict technical definition of machine.</p>

<p>Such machines as are used in shaping materials in the construction
of the parts of other machines, and also many of those
which perform work, such as boring, planing, riveting, etc.,
formerly only done by hand, and still performed manually to a
greater or less extent, are nearly always called machine tools;
the term, engine tool, is more in accord with general usage
when referring to large and complicated machines.</p>

<p><em>It is by his knowledge of the application of hand-tools and
their practical use, that the pump attendant is judged by those
around him.</em> The skillful mechanic, who with many others,
constructs a machine, may be neglected, but one who skillfully
operates the apparatus, seldom fails of due credit and reward,
hence these paragraphs are intended to emphasize the importance
of these more humble implements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_610">610</a> represents <em>a pipe cutter</em>—a hand tool specially used for
cutting of wrought iron, steel or brass pipe. This tool consists of a
cast steel body, tapped in one end to receive the adjusting screw or
handle which also serves to rotate the tool when applied to a pipe.
The cutting is generally effected by a hardened cast steel cutter
with cutting edges having angles of about 60&deg; like a V thread; an

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_611">611</a> shows <em>a ratchet drill</em>; this is a tool in which the rotary
motion of the drill is derived from a ratchet and pawl actuated by a
lever or handle. There are various forms of this class of tools. This
one is the “Packer ratchet.” The thread for adjusting or feeding the
drill is protected from chips and dirt by a sleeve which covers the
shank.</p>

<p>The center is of tempered tool steel as well as the ratchet and
pawl. The socket is usually made square.</p>

<p><em>In cutting larger sizes of pipes</em> sometimes a special cutting-tool
is introduced in place of the circular cutter to accomplish the more
difficult work; in shop practice it is customary to cut the large sizes
of pipe in a lathe or screwing machine.</p>

<p>The three tools shown on this page are designed to prepare
the pipe for the reception of the threaded end of the pipe to
be joined. The upper one, Fig. <a href="#fig_612">612</a>, is <em>a reamer</em> used to enlarge
a hole, or to round up one that has been drilled or cut with a
chisel, to prepare it for tapping. The lower, Fig. <a href="#fig_614">614</a>, is <em>the tap</em>
which cuts the thread. The middle, Fig. <a href="#fig_613">613</a>, is a <em>combined drill
and tap</em> which is operated by a ratchet and is used to drill and
tap a hole <em>in water pipe</em>, etc., at one operation.</p>

<p>“<em>Tapping</em>” is the process by which the thread is formed in
the interior of a hole, and is done with a tap; <em>screwing</em> is the
reverse process by
which the thread
is formed on the
outside of a cylindrical
surface, as
a pipe or round
bar of iron.</p>

<p><em>A tap consists
of an external
screw</em> of the required
size, formed
of steel and more
or less tapered,
part of the thread
being cut away by
longitudinal
grooves in order
to present a series of cutting edges. By screwing into a nut
in the manner of an ordinary bolt this tap forms the thread
required.</p>

<p><em>Plug-taps</em> are usually made in sets of three. The first, called
<em>the entering tap</em> or taper tap, generally tapers regularly throughout
its length; the second, or <em>intermediate tap</em>, sometimes
tapers, but is usually cylindrical with two or three tapering
threads at the end; the third, called the plug-tap or <em>bottoming-tap</em>,
is always parallel, with the full thread carried to the end.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_615">615</a> shows <em>a crow</em>. This is used to hook underneath a pipe and
to support and feed a ratchet drill in cutting a hole. The sliding head
is fastened by a double ended gib key which secures it in any desired
position. <em>A swivel bench vise</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_616">616</a>. This tool has
cast steel jaws with a wrought iron slide and is attached to the bench
with a screw so that it may be turned in any position.</p>

<p><em>A pipe vise</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_617">617</a>. This is mounted on a journal
bearing so that it may be clamped in any position from a horizontal to
a perpendicular.</p>

<p><em>The pipe vise is especially a bench tool</em>; it is designed to
“grip” pipes of various sizes while they are being threaded,
cut off or otherwise operated upon.</p>

<p><em>A parallel</em> or ordinary bench vise will only grip a pipe on
two opposite sides, and, if tightened, the strain will easily collapse
it, owing to its hollow form; but a pipe vise is so made
that it presses upon four points, as the jaws or holding portions
are formed V shaped, instead of parallel.</p>

<p>Some pipe vises are formed of two pivoted discs instead of
jaws, having semicircles or recesses, which fit all diameters of
pipes up to two inches, and bear on the outside of the pipe all
around.</p>

<p>It is an improvement to have the upper portion of the vise
hinged at one side, and fixed with a pin or collar at the other,
as by opening the jaws it renders more convenient the removal
or insertion of the pipe to be operated upon.</p>

<p>The upper Fig. <a href="#fig_618">618</a> on page 342 represents an indispensable
tool for cutting pipe threads by hand; one handle—of which
there are two—is shown in the figure immediately beneath <em>the
pipe stock and die</em>, which is the familiar name of the combination.
The <em>guard</em> in the illustration is thrown open to
allow the <em>die</em> to be removed or exchanged. Fig. <a href="#figs_620_621_622">620</a> represents
the latter; solid steel dies are commonly used, but <em>adjustable
dies</em> are made. Figs. <a href="#figs_620_621_622">621</a> and <a href="#figs_620_621_622">622</a> are <em>bushings</em> to fit in the end
of the stock to guide the pipe; there is one bushing for each
size of pipe.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_623">623</a> shows a <em>nipple-holder</em> which is used to hold short
pieces of pipe by the thread upon one end, while the die is
applied to cut a thread upon the other end. This tool is
generally used in a pipe cutting machine, which is operated by
power, but it can also be held in a common vise.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The die may be centered on the nipple described above by <em>placing
in the die stock</em> a guide bushing that will easily ride over the nipple
holder. The thread can now be cut until the die just touches the nipple
holder, and there will be practically no blank space between the threads on
the ends. After the die has been backed off the nipple can be removed from
the holder by unscrewing the center with a monkey wrench. <em>A nipple
holder should be made for each size of pipe that is cut and threaded by hand.</em>
A piece of pipe with a coupling on its end may be used as an improvised
nipple holder.</p></div>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_625">625</a> represents the <em>Trimo pipe wrench</em>. This name is
an abbreviation of the word Tremont from the street in Boston
of that name. It is adjusted to its work by a milled nut in
the pivoted jaw; the latter is brought into position at each
stroke by a leaf spring attached to the main lever. In the
larger sizes the steel jaws are removable or can be detached
and replaced after being repaired. The lower engraving, Fig.
<a href="#fig_626">626</a>, is a <em>chain tongs</em> with removable, tool-steel jaws. The
hard scale on the piping rapidly destroys the sharp edges on
these jaws so that they require frequent sharpening. The links
of the chain have a peculiar hook form so that they cannot slip.</p>

<p><em>A spanner</em>, shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_627">627</a>, is a special form of wrench,

<p><em>Screw or monkey-wrenches</em> are those which have a movable
jaw, so that the tool may be adjusted to fit any sized nut within
its compass; as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_628">628</a>. There are many designs
of monkey-wrenches. The one here represented is known
as the “knife-handle” on account of the identical construction
of the handle of this wrench and that of a pocket knife. It is
strong and the shank is extra heavy so that it is hardly possible
to spring the jaws in fair use.</p>

<p><em>An interchangeable socket wrench</em> is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_629">629</a>. The
handle is much like a ratchet drill, having a pawl and ratchet
wheel attached to the sockets; these are for use upon various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
sizes of hexagon or square heads, as represented by figures
underneath the handle. Some of these socket wrenches have
forms of steel for insertion into the hole in the ratchet by which
different shaped and sized bolt heads and nuts may be turned
without changing the main socket.</p>

<p><em>The word wrench</em> which gives this term to the tools here
described is one of the strong words of the English language;
wrench means, primarily, “a violent twist or turn given to
something,” hence, as derived, almost any instrument that
causes a twist or torsional strain comes under this heading. A
wrench is a tool used by hand to turn or rotate other tools,
nuts or bolts.</p>

<p>A wrench is specially designated according to its shape and
of the jaws or openings, as an open-end box-wrench, etc. If
the opening is through one end, it is termed <em>a single-ended
wrench</em>; if it is in the middle, <em>a double-ended</em> or tap-wrench.
If the recess is open, it is termed <em>an open-ended wrench</em>; if
closed, forming a square or hexagon opening through the metal,
<em>a box-wrench</em>. A solid wrench having a notched angular recess
in its end, so that any nut or bolt which will enter the jaws
can be grasped, is called <em>an alligator-wrench</em>.</p>

<p><em>The hammer</em> was probably the first tool used by mankind;
hammers of stone are found among the remains of antiquity,
and these are still in common use among barbarous races. The
hammer is made in such a variety of forms that it is almost impossible
to classify it; it is named not only for the use to
which it is put, but after the trade-class which uses it, as the
machinist hammer, the blacksmith-hammer, etc.</p>

<p>The hammer is made of high-grade steel, carefully tempered
head and peen; the head is usually made cylindrical with slightly
rounding face; the eye of the hammer is the center opening
through which the handle is inserted. The peen of a hammer
is the opposite end to the face, and terminates in a rounded or
wedge-shaped point.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In its use <em>the hammer should be grasped near the end of the
handle</em>, giving it a free arm swing, and carrying the head through a nearly
vertical plane. If the plane of the swing approaches a horizontal the weight
of the hammer will produce a twisting effort on the fore-arm, which will be
very tiresome. <em>The handle should be grasped with only sufficient force to safely control the blow</em>.</p></div>

<h3>VALVES AND COCKS.</h3></div>

<p>The word <em>valve</em> comes from the Latin—<em>valva</em>—a leaf, fold
or valve of a door (as of a folding door).</p>

<p>A valve may act automatically so as to be <em>opened</em> by the
effort of a fluid to pass in one direction and <em>closed</em> by its effort
to pass in the other direction, as a clack valve; or it may be
opened or closed by hand or mechanism, as a screw valve or a
slide valve. <em>In the glossary</em> at the beginning of this work, the
word has been carefully defined and several illustrations have
been given of various designs of the device which have come
into general use.</p>

<p>Valves are of several classes.</p>

<p>1. <em>Rotary</em>; such as <em>cocks</em>, <em>faucets</em>, <em>plug throttle-valves</em>.</p>

<p>2. <em>Lifting</em>; raised clear from the seat by power beneath;
such as <em>ball</em>, <em>conical</em>, <em>cup</em>, <em>safety</em>, <em>poppet</em>.</p>

<p>3. <em>Hinged</em>; such as <em>clack</em>, <em>butterfly</em>.</p>

<p>4. <em>Sliding</em>; such as the <em>slide</em>, <span class="sans"><b>D</b></span>, <span class="sans"><b>B</b></span> and <em>box</em>.</p>

<p>5. <em>Spring</em>; such as <em>some forms of safety-valves</em>, Snifting
and Relief valves.</p>

<p>6. <em>Inverted-cup</em>; such as <em>quicksilver valve</em>, <em>air trap</em>, etc.</p>

<p>7. <em>Key</em>; such as those of the <em>organ</em>, <em>flute</em>, etc.</p>

<p>Other names are derived from peculiar shape, application,
mode of actuation, etc.</p>

<p><em>A cock</em> is a faucet or rotary valve usually taking its name
from its peculiar use or construction, as:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="noindent large">
Blow-off cock,<br />
Cylinder-cock,<br />
Feed-cock,<br />
Four-way cock,<br />
Gage-cock,<br />
Oil-cock,<br />
Self-closing cock,<br />
Steam-cock,<br />
Stop-cock,<br />
Three-way cock,<br />
Try-cock,<br />
Water-cock, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The above classification is that made by E. H. Knight, Civil and
mechanical Engineer, etc., and author of Knight’s Mechanical Dictionary.
He adds: “The heart is created upon the principles of hydraulics, and is
furnished with a valve. Harvey deduced the circulation of the blood from
Aquapendente’s discovery of the <em>valves in the veins</em>.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span></p>

<p>As may be judged by the preceding paragraphs, giving the
names derived from their mechanical and other uses of several
only, of a great many varieties of valves, it were vain to attempt
a complete list of these devices; it may be said however
that the whole system of modern mechanism would be, almost,
if not quite, a failure, if they were not used.</p>

<p>Hence, the student will do well to familiarize himself with
the valve movements sure to be found in every combination of
industrial and mechanical forces.</p>

<p>A few illustrations of the adaptation of valves of various
designs to useful purposes now follow.—</p>

<p><em>A combined throttle and quick closing trip valve</em> is shown
in Fig. <a href="#fig_609">609</a>, page 336; this is made by Schutte &amp; Koerting Co.,
Philadelphia; this apparatus is designed to fill the requirements
of <em>an emergency shut-off; the valve is balanced</em> and operates as
stop and throttle. The object of balancing the valve is to remove
the strain from the spindle, so that its operation can be
effected quickly and with the least effort. The piston above the
valve is not tight fitting, and contains <em>a small auxiliary or
pilot valve</em> attached to the spindle, which opens in advance of
the opening of the main valve; thus the pressure above the
piston and below the valve is equalized; little effort is now
required to lift the main valve, at the same time the pilot valve,
E, answers the purpose of a by-pass.</p>

<p>The several proportions are such that a slight over-pressure
is maintained above the piston to give the valve, at all times,
a tendency to close. This over-pressure should be but slight,
and to regulate it at will there is (besides the leak around the
piston) <em>a separate steam admission above the piston, regulated
by the plug, C</em>.</p>

<p>Depending on the fit of the piston, this plug is opened
more or less, or entirely closed, when valve is first put in operation,
and then locked in that position.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the construction of this valve demands the application
of a screw-spindle to actuate it; <em>it is also made in
angle form and can be placed with spindle upward or horizontal</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
In all positions, globe, inverted and angle valves, steam must
always enter above the disc, viz., in the direction of the arrows.</p>

<div class="image-right" id="fig_633">
<img src="images/i_p349.jpg" width="200" height="452" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 633.</span></p></div>

<p><em>The operation by lever is demanded when a valve is used
as a quick emergency shut-off</em>, either by hand or in connection
with automatic appliance of governor, electrical cut-off or
auxiliary, steam, air or hydraulic cylinder.</p>

<p>The valve itself is of the balanced form, except that in this valve
<em>the spindle carries at the bottom a small piston or sleeve, F</em>, shown
in the figure. The valve is locked open by moving hand lever up till
the catch on same engages with the lever, G, supported on the upright
bar.</p>

<p>The valve being then open, steam pressure acts on the area of the
piston, F, with continuous downward force, which will cause the valve
to close as soon as the latch is released. Thus, by connecting the
rod on the outer end of lever, G, with a hand lever, at any desired
location, the operation is had without effort and promptly.</p>

<p><em>A pressure reducing valve</em> is shown in outline and a side view in
Figs. <a href="#fig_633">633</a> and <a href="#fig_634">634</a>; this is in effect a (Mason) pump pressure regulator
and it is applicable for fire, tank, elevator, air and water works
pumps, or any class of pumping machinery where it is necessary to
maintain a constant pressure. The regulator may be quickly adjusted to
any pressure desired by turning the key as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_633">633</a>.</p>

<p>The especial feature of this regulator is that the pressure
chamber into which the water enters is entirely removed and
separate from the steam and all working parts.</p>

<p>The long cylinder at the bottom of the regulator is a dashpot,
the piston of which is connected with the main valve of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
the regulator, thereby preventing sudden and violent “jumping”
of the pump when the pressure suddenly changes. These
valves are made in all the pipe sizes; those up to and including
2-inch of the best steam metal; the largest sizes of cast iron,
lined with steam metal. <em>The springs are made of the finest tool
steel, tempered.</em></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_634">
<img src="images/i_p350.jpg" width="269" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 634.</span></p></div>

<p>The Mason Regulator Co., Boston, are to be credited with the
following directions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The regulator is placed in the steam pipe leading from the boiler to
the steam pump and as near the pump as possible. The connection with
the water system is made either from the tank or from the water system,
at some little distance from the pump. Brass pipe should be used if
possible, for this connection. The drip should be connected to some
pipe where there is no back pressure. The steam from the boiler enters
at the point marked “steam inlet from boiler,” and thence through the
passage, X, through the port, which is kept open by the tension of the
spring, 79, upon the auxiliary valve, 80. It continues down through
the passage, Z, to the under side of the differential piston, 70, and
raises the valve, 16, so that the boiler pressure is admitted to the
pump through the passage marked “steam outlet to pump.” This starts the
pump, which continues in motion until the required water pressure is
obtained in the system and acts through the connection marked “water
pressure inlet” on the diaphragm, 74. This diaphragm is raised by the
excess of water pressure, and carries with it the auxiliary valve,
80, which closes the port for steam pressure. By the closing of this
valve, the boiler pressure is shut off through the passage, Z, from
the differential piston, 70, and the steam pressure from the boiler
immediately closes the main valve, 16, so that no more pressure is
admitted to the pump, which remains inactive until the water pressure
in the system drops below the normal joint and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span> relieves the water
pressure in the chamber, O, which causes the auxiliary valve, 80,
to open again, and starts the pump as before described. The check
valve, 71, which is placed in the bottom of the piston, 70, allows the
pressure regulator to open easily, but stops the pump quickly. This is
a great advantage, as the pump will not start with a jump, the moment
the water drops. By changing the tension of the spring, 83, through the
key stem, 85, the amount of water pressure can be regulated.</p></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 635.</span></p></div>

<p><em>Mason water reducing valve.</em> Fig. <a href="#fig_635">635</a> is designed to reduce
the water pressure from the street water mains to a low pressure,
for houses and buildings. The body or valve portion is fitted with
couplings, so that it may be easily attached to a pipe. That part of
the valve above the diaphragm, and which comes in contact with the
water, is made of the best steam metal, thus preventing corrosion. The
long spring case is made of heavy iron pipe, at the end of which is
an iron bracket, suitably drilled, so that the valve may be securely
bolted either to the floor or to a beam overhead. The tension of the
main spring is adjusted by means of a small rod inserted in a nut at
the end of the spring case. The diaphragm is very strong and will hold
several times the pressure required. The working of this regulator
is very simple. The water enters through the inlet coupling, 45, and
passes through the chamber, 68, into the low pressure side of the
regulator, the valve, 43, being held open by the tension of the spring,
53. When the low pressure has attained the desired limit, which is also
felt in the diaphragm chamber through the hole which communicates with
the chamber, 68, it forces down the diaphragm and seats the valve, 43.
When the pressure again drops in the system, the diaphragm is forced up
by the spring, 53, and the valve, 43, again opens.</p>

<p><em>An automatic throttle valve</em> for a boiler feed pump is shown
perspective and outline in Figs. <a href="#fig_636">636</a> and <a href="#fig_637">637</a>; this is a governor
for the pump, controlled by the relative pressures of steam and
water. It is known as <em>Mullin’s automatic controller</em> and is
made at Seattle, Wash., and has the following features:</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_636">
<img src="images/i_p352_fig_636.jpg" width="550" height="292" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 636.</span></p></div>

<p>It is simply a balance valve and differential piston; it is in a
class by itself, both as to its construction and operation in regulating
feed water pressure in connection with steam boilers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_637">
<img src="images/i_p352_fig_637.jpg" width="500" height="291" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 637.</span></p></div>

<p>The initial steam pressure being on the ends of the valve,
has access, through the neck, to the full area of the piston, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
will force it into a position that gives the full valve opening,
where it will remain until overcome by water pressure from the
pump, acting against the opposite side, which is of reduced area.</p>

<p>It is necessary in operating this valve to have <em>an excess of
water pressure over the steam pressure</em> in the boiler. The excess
of the water pressure is obtained by the reduction of the area
of the water side of the piston—thus to illustrate—if the total
area were 10 square inches, and the reduction was one inch or
10 per cent., it would require that the water pressure should be
10 per cent. greater than steam pressure, to give the same thrust
on the piston, then until the water has reached a pressure 10
per cent. in excess of the steam, the valve would be held open,
but thereafter it is held open only wide enough to admit steam
to the pump to keep up this 10 per cent. excess pressure.
Should the excess pressure attempt to rise above this, it immediately
forces the steam valve nearly shut, thus nipping
the cause of the rise, namely, too great a piston speed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—“In starting the pump, ‘stand by’ until it has caught suction,
and accumulated nearly the correct water pressure, now open the valve on
the pulse, or pressure pipe to the controller and open pump throttle wide,
thus giving the controller free action.</p>

<p>“Suppose the boiler pressure is 100 pounds, the water pressure will be 10
per cent. higher or 110 lbs. Carrying an even fire, with water at second
gauge, feed valves properly set, the load suddenly increases, which pulls
steam down to 99 pounds, the water does not remain at 110 lbs. as before,
but is now 10 per cent. in excess of 90 lbs. or 99 lbs., thus in place of 10 lbs.
excess water pressure there is but 9 lbs., which means there will be less
water delivered through the feed valves, which will hardly ever have to be
touched.</p>

<p>“Next the load will lighten—steam will rise, and the excess pressure will
automatically increase, thus restoring the water used at a time when it was
most necessary to lighten the feed to temporarily favor the fire.</p>

<p>“Suppose the load continues light, with good fires, steam rises to 110
pounds, the water will rise to 10 per cent. more pressure or 121 pounds, thus
automatically giving more pressure to ‘feed up’ on high steam, and store
away the heat that would be wasted by radiation, absorption, or perhaps
blowing off.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>The water pressure will vary only as the steam pressure
varies, always keeping the same per cent. of excess. The results
are directly opposite to what would or does occur where feed
water is delivered at a stated pressure. On a battery of boilers,
during the cleaning of fires, the closing of feed valves on one,
two or more boilers, does not affect the feed of those already
set in the least, the pump will simply make less strokes necessary
to properly feed the others.</p>

<p>The regulating is done by the feed valves at the boilers; if it is
desired, all feeds may be closed, and the pressure will not rise, the
pump will stop; if its plungers need packing it will be detected by the
fact that the pump will creep, to keep up the required pressure. When
feed valves are once regulated to admit the required amount of water,
to replace the evaporation, <em>they may be marked</em>, and when in this
position, they, with an even steam pressure, will always admit the same
amount of water to the boilers.</p>

<p>It is understood that this valve is placed between the
ordinary throttle valve and the pump.</p>

<p><em>The Bordo blow-off valve</em> is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_638">638</a> and <a href="#fig_639">639</a>; it consists
of a brass or iron body which resembles the shell of a plug-cock,
but with this difference, it has a sharper taper than the
regular plug-cock; in this device the plug is usually made of
brass—tinned on the outside. In process of making and while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
hot a sheath of babbitt metal or its equivalent is cast upon the
plug; the metals amalgamate and practically become one casting.</p>

<p>The parts of valve are as follows, 1, the body, 2, the
plug, 3, the packing and lifting gland, 4, the lifting cam, 5, lock-nut,
6, two brass rings of equal size, with a special gasket between
them—all as shown in the engravings.</p>

<p><em>The valve is operated</em> with a wrench on the square of the plug.
The lifting gland when adjusted is permanently held by a lock-nut. By
releasing the lock-nut with the wrench and turning the gland to the
left, the plug is lifted so that it will turn easily. When the lock-nut
is moved up, the lifting cam (which couples the packing gland to the
plug) can be pulled out; the gland is then free to be removed for
repacking. In use the best method of handling is to open and close the
valve slowly—never with a jerk.</p>

<h3>PIPES AND FITTINGS.</h3></div>

<p><em>A pipe</em> was originally a wind instrument of music, consisting
of a <em>tube or tubes</em> of straw, reed, wood or metal; in the literature
of hydraulics this wind instrument becomes “<em>a long tube or
hollow body of wood, metal, earthenware, or the like</em>; especially,
one used as a conductor of water, steam, gas, etc.”</p>

<p><em>A pipe fitter</em> is one who fits pipes together, or applies pipes,
as to an engine or pump. A pipe fitter uses all the tools already
described and in addition several others, as stretched lines, the
spirit level and plumb-bob; he also uses special devices to aid
in special cases; these are sometimes invented by himself and
sometimes belong to “the trade-lore” transmitted in the long
and varied operations of every successful shop. <em>A pipe fitting</em>
is a piece, as a coupling, a valve, etc., used for connecting
lengths of pipe or as accessory to a pipe. <em>Joint</em> comes from
the word join and means the place or part where two things or
parts are joined or united as a joint in a pipe. See note below.</p>

<p>Narrow surfaces make better and safer joints than wide
ones; they are more quickly repaired with file or scraper, and
they are less liable to catch dirt at the moment of making
a joint. The limit of narrowness is that required to resist
strains that might crush the metal and spoil the face of the
joint.</p>

<p>Unless the joint is made metal to metal, fitting without any
orifice, the jointing material is always softer than the pipes or
other things to be joined. In this way the jointing need not
have dead-true surfaces, but, yielding under pressure, it adapts
itself to the space it has to fill. It must be dense enough and
hard enough to resist all the working strains and influences
that are likely to act upon it. The jointing of a steam pipe
must resist the temperature of the steam, the water it carries
with it, the changes of temperature
when the pipe cools during
intervals of work, and the strains
due to the weight of the pipe,
and also the internal pressure
of the steam. If it expands
differently from the metal in
the pipe, it must be sufficiently
elastic to compensate for this
expansion, otherwise it will leak
each time the pipes cool down.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In proportion as steam pressure gets higher joints are made
thinner and flanges smoother. In the past rough turning succeeded chipping,
rough filing followed with an application of the surface plate, and
finally the scraper was used to produce a dead-true surface, which is now
only cleaned and wet with heavy mineral oil to withstand any pressure
whatsoever.</p></div>

<p>The joint should be always inside the line of bolts, and if any
joint material extends beyond, it would only help to support the flange
in case it should spring. This, of course, indicates faulty design,
for flanges ought to bear the strains of jointing without perceptible
spring. Male and female flanges are best for high pressures.</p>

<p>A very popular joint is made with a planed or turned surface and
a sheet of paper of the quality used to wrap bales of paper. This is
the last survival of the millboard. Rubbed over the flange with a
dirty hand and cut out with a penknife on a board, this is one of the
cheapest jointings known. This paper has no lumps or grit in it, and
if smeared with mineral cylinder oil it may be separated several times
before it is spoiled. It is largely used on the faced joints of small
engines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[
361]</a></span> steam pumps. The mineral oil increases the life of the
paper when exposed to high steam. Sheet asbestos is better.</p>

<p><em>Hydraulic joints for high pressure</em> require greater rigidity than
those of steam, but they do not have to bear high temperatures. The
jointing material may be more or less plastic, such as leather, rubber
or gutta percha. It is generally inclosed in a groove in the flange,
and compressed by a projection fitting the groove, so that expansion
of the jointing is arrested and the space is completely filled. There
is no better principle for joints than this where packing is used
between flanges. At a pressure of three tons to the inch, every square
sixteenth of an inch must resist a power equal to twenty-six pounds;
the joint must therefore be non-porous.</p>

<p><em>There are compounds used for making joints</em> on which the plastic
matter, which is subject to much change of volume between the liquid
and solid state, is mixed with a neutral substance, like sand, which,
combining mechanically with it, replaces from 90 to 95 per cent. of the
total mass, and reduces its shrinkage to an inappreciable quantity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_653">
<img src="images/i_p362_fig_653.jpg" width="250" height="244" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 653.</span></p></div>

<p>Another class of joints is that into which the jointing material is
poured in a liquid state. Most of those liquids, such as lead, pitch,
putty, sealing-wax, beeswax, or clay, shrink when they dry or cool.
Others, like <em>Portland cement</em> and certain metallic alloys, do not
change in volume. Others, again, like sulphur and plaster of Paris,
increase in volume in setting. These substances all vary in their
elasticity, qualities of density, hardness, and powers of resisting
heat, cold and moisture. The duty of a joint must, therefore, be well
considered before the material is chosen, after which the recess in
which it is to lie must be carefully designed so as to firmly hold the
material and with the least possible waste.</p>

<p><em>Kerosene</em>, from its solvent powers, will destroy joints of rubber
or of cements compounded with oils. Kerosene tanks are, therefore,
rust-jointed and calked. As kerosene does not dissolve anything that
is soluble in water or alcohol, kerosene casks are coated with glue
to make them tight. India rubber may be used as a kerosene joint if
inclosed like the hydraulic joint, and prevented from swelling. It is

<p><em>In making up a piece of piping</em> in which several fittings are
quite close together, each fitting is tightened separately; do not
follow the common practice of making up loosely at first
and then tightening all together by applying a wrench to the
fitting farthest from the main connection, as this process does
not insure tight joints and the intermediate fittings, nipples,
etc., are subjected to an unnecessary torsional strain.</p>

<p>The proper arrangement of pipe connections have already
been alluded to in Part One, page 222; it is a subject whose
importance can scarcely be magnified for if any difficulty is experienced
in making a pump work properly when first started,
it will generally be found to proceed from imperfect connections,
and this remains true quite to the end of the usefulness
of the pump. By a careful study of the illustration above
mentioned, a good degree of attention will be repaid.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#figs_641_642">641</a> and <a href="#figs_641_642">642</a> represent pipes which are specially intended
for <em>mine pump columns</em> or discharge pipes. They are
made in sizes from six inches to thirty inches outside diameter;
they are of wrought iron, lap welded and tested to a pressure
of five hundred pounds to the square inch; they are fitted with
cast iron or steel flanges, bolts and gaskets which face square
with the center line of the pipe.</p>

<p><em>Steam Pipe Lines.</em> These are constructed of cast iron or
wrought iron and used for conveying a supply of steam from
the boilers to engines, pumps, turbines and other machines
driven by steam. Usually these lines are built up with straight
pipe and “fittings.” The names of the latter are as follows:
elbows; forty-fives (45&deg;); tees; plugs; caps; reducers (or bushings);
nipples; valves; unions (with ground, perishable, and
flange joints); couplings (reducing and right and left); crosses;
special fittings, such as elbows and tees of a nominal size reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
at some point to a smaller size to avoid the use of reducers;
angle, check, and gate valves, and plug cocks; lock-nuts.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Cast iron was formerly entirely employed for steam pipe, but
now it is never used for high pressures.</p>

<p>While lead and iron pipe have taken the place of the old log pipes of
former days for carrying water and sundry purposes, there are still uses for
which wooden pipe is better adapted than any of the metal pipes; a new
kind of wire wound wooden pipe has been made. Each length is built up
of staves, wound with galvanized steel wire under tension. The sizes are
made 2 to 8 inches internal diameter. The staves are kiln-dried, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch to
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch thick. Joints are made with a male and female socket on the small
sizes, and a sleeve and butt joint on the larger sizes, 8-inch pipe of this type,
wound with No. 4 copper wire, has been tried, where acid water rapidly
destroys ordinary pipes, with excellent results. This pipe has been tested
to 500 pounds pressure, it is lighter to handle and is not so liable to burst as
cast iron.</p></div>

<p><em>The proper anchoring and supporting of large steam mains
is important.</em> It is preferable to allow the system to expand
in the proper direction without stress and at the same time
avoiding vibration. The illustrations will give an idea of the
method used in supporting pipes and allowing for expansion.
Fig. <a href="#fig_657">657</a> shows a wall bracket upon which the rollers supporting
the pipe and allowing for the expansion and contraction
are attached. Fig. <a href="#fig_655">655</a> shows a bracket with an adjustable
single roll, which may be adjusted to suit the pitch of the pipe
at the same time allow the pipe to expand.</p>

<p><em>Fig. <a href="#fig_655">655</a> shows a bracket</em> with one adjustable roll designed
for main steam pipes. This is an elaborate device but would
be appreciated in buildings where everything is wanted to make
up a strictly first class line of details.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_657">657</a> represents an extension of the same idea in which
one bracket is made to carry two lines of pipe smaller than the
one shown in the preceding illustration. Fig. <a href="#fig_656">656</a> is a support
made of one inch round iron and answers every purpose where
all of these designs of pipe hangers permit of free expansion
and contraction of the pipes.</p>

<p>It is bad practice to support the main steam pipes over
boilers by hangers from the building as the building may settle
in a different degree from the boiler hence the steam pipes are
not properly supported, <em>i.e.</em>, they are either strained unnecessarily
by the strain upon the hangers or they are permitted to
support themselves; it is better to support them by iron props
underneath, made by screwing a flange upon the end of a piece
of pipe of proper length and having a wrought iron crotch with
thread and nut for adjustment inserted in the upper end.</p>

<p>The flange on the prop rests upon the boiler walls while the
crotch fits the pipe and by means of the nut any desirable
elevation of the steam pipe may be secured. For when the
boilers settle as they will the pipes and connections all settle
together.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_650">650</a> shows <em>the bell and spigot connection</em> commonly

formed by pouring melted lead into the cavity inside the bell.
The melted lead is prevented from escaping by damming up
the opening with a turn of oakum at the bottom and fire clay
at the top of the joint. After the lead cools it is calked with
a calking tool. Fig. <a href="#fig_651">651</a> is similar to Fig. <a href="#fig_643">643</a> only the latter

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_652">652</a> represents an improvement on the union shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig_646">646</a>. It is known as <em>the Dart-union</em>. The improvement
consists in the substitution of a ball and socket joint made of
composition brass or bronze ground joint and enclosed within
the malleable iron case; unions are particularly desirable for
inaccessible locations where it would be next to impossible to
reach the union to renew the gasket.</p>

<p>All “tubing,” including boiler tubes, is measured by the
<em>outside diameters</em>, while gas and steam pipe, including cast iron
water pipe is designated by the inside diameter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The best way of jointing hydraulic pipes has been the subject of
much practical experiment. A gutta percha ring has been universally
adopted as the best means of preserving the joint watertight. Modified
form of this joint is made by casting a projection on the pipe beyond the
flange, the bell and spigot being formed on this projection. The effect is
to increase the depth and the strength of the flange, without an increase of
its section at the junction between the flange and the pipe.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>

<p>Much might be said regarding duplicate pipe systems, both
for and against. The general practice is coming to be that of
subdividing into units, while in smaller plants the duplicate
system is used. The service and conditions govern the method
of piping, which should be such in every instance as to prevent
a shut down due to accident in some part of the system.</p>

<p>All the fittings in the pipe system of a plant should be of
the best quality, and the piping for high pressures should be
extra heavy to withstand the test of time and usage. Water
pipes, when of commercial wrought iron, should be galvanized.</p>

<p>In laying out a line of piping or in replacing a portion of an
existing line <em>the measurements should be taken from center to center</em>
of the various fittings; the allowance for the threaded part of the
pipe can be made after the center-to-center and over-all measurements
have been made and before the pipe is cut. Experience teaches what
to allow for the threaded part on different sizes of pipe. The
accompanying engraving gives an illustration of how the measurements on
a pipe system are made.</p>

<h3>USEFUL NOTES<br />
<span class="smcap small">Relating to Pumps and their Management</span></h3></div>

<p><em>It happens at times</em> that a pump, with the full pressure
against which it is expected to work, resting upon the discharge
valves, refuses to lift water for the reason that air within
the pump chamber is not dislodged, but only compressed by
the motion of the plunger. It is well, therefore, to arrange for
running without pressure until the air is expelled and water
follows. This is done by <em>placing a check valve in the delivery
pipe, and providing a waste cock in the discharge chamber to be
closed after the pump has caught water</em>. A stop valve is also
required for shutting off the back pressure when the pump
can be opened for examination of the valves.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>If any difficulty is experienced in making a pump work
properly when first started, it will generally be found in leaks
through <em>imperfect connections</em>, or from the temporary stiffness
to be expected in a new machine, or perhaps leaky valves.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>If, when standing at the suction end of a centrifugal pump,
looking over pump shell toward pulley, the top of shaft revolves
from right to left, or against the sun, <em>the pump is right
hand</em>, and if from left to right, or with the sun, <em>it is left hand</em>.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>A pump should be located in a convenient</em> as well as a clean
place. It should be well set upon a suitable foundation, so
that it may be free from vibration or jar; this “note” applies
to direct-acting, self-contained pumps, as well as to others.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span></p>

<p>The economical operation of a pump depends, to a great
extent, upon the kind and condition of the packing in the
stuffing-boxes and pistons, its quality, adaptability to particular
requirements, and the method of placing it in the stuffing-boxes
and plungers.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Almost all the stuffing-boxes on pumps are too shallow and
the glands too short. To keep a rod tight under these conditions
the packing must be of the proper size and quality, and
it must be put in with a view to securing the greatest possible
degree of elasticity, so that the rod may be kept tight with the
least pressure on the packing.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>To do this, it is best to select packing which will permit a
number of narrow rings to be used instead of a few wide rings.
The rings next to the bottom will become dry and hard before
those next to the glands of the box are half worn out. If a
number of narrow rings are used, the dry ones may be removed
and duplicated by new ones and replacing the rest of the
packing in the stuffing-box. This method economizes packing
and secures a tight yet freely working rod.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>When patent square packings are used, it makes less difference
whether the rings are narrow or wide, because the surface
in contact with the rod will be nearly continuous in either case.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>When cutting packing rings, the length should be such that
the ends do not come together within <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch when put into the
stuffing-box, and the rings are put in to break joints, which
prevents leakage through them.</p>

<p>When inserting this packing, the rings are put in one at a
time, using a piece of hard wood to push them to the bottom
of the stuffing-box and firmly against one another. The stuffing-box
should be filled as full as it can be, and start the nuts
on the studs by hand. Screw up the nuts with the hand and
then start the pump slowly. If leakage occurs do not attempt
to tighten the nut while the rod is in motion, and in all cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
tighten it only enough to stop the leakage. A slight leakage
at the water end is not harmful. A little cylinder oil and
graphite occasionally applied to the rod will tend to keep it
smooth and bright, which condition is favorable to the durability
of the rod and of the packing.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>When cutting rings of packing for the water piston or
plunger, the rings should be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch short, as previously described,
page 372.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Packing should fit the grooves in solid pistons moderately
tight, so that the packing can be pushed into the grooves with
the fingers. The depth of the packing should be such that the
piston will fit the bore of the water cylinder snugly when first
put in. If packing of the proper depth cannot be obtained, it
is better to have the grooves turned to receive standard sizes
of packing and not require special sizes. Cutting hydraulic
packing is a tedious job, consuming a great deal of unnecessary
time.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>It takes less power to feed into the bottom of a tank than
it does into the top</em>, on account of the weight of water in the
tank. The bottom of the tank holds up all the water except
the column directly over the opening of the delivery pipe, so
that the additional pressure on the pump is due only to the
depth of water in the tank, not to the size of the body, and it
is impossible to feed into the top without increasing the height
of the column fully as much. It makes no difference whether
the height is due to the depth of the water inside the tank or
an additional length of pipe outside.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>The duty of the air pump is solely to get rid of the water
and air in the condenser.</em> It adds to the efficiency of the condensing
apparatus, and renders its operation continuous; its
valve being thrown by the action of its own piston, it must
complete its stroke in length whether the piston is moving in
air, water or vapor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span></p>

<p><em>Pumps should be kept clean internally and externally.</em> In
order to keep a pump clean internally it must be inspected and
oiled internally at regular intervals the same as it is
externally.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>When pumps fail to work properly the difficulty is generally
located in one of three places, viz.: <em>the water end, the steam
end or the suction pipe</em>.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>The several parts of the valve gear of a single cylinder pump
<em>should be marked when the pump works properly</em>, then any
trouble due to the slipping of the collars or tappets can readily
be remedied; if the nuts and set screws are kept tight,
derangements occur only at long intervals.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>The principal difficulties encountered with steam pumps
are not generally due to improper steam distribution, but to
wear, as may be seen; hence by inspecting pumps at regular
intervals many unpleasant occurrences and accidents can be
avoided.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>The steam pipe leading to a pump</em> should be so arranged that
the water of condensation, while the pump is idle, may not
pass through the steam chest and cylinders, and wash off the
lubricating oil. Drip cocks should be attached to steam pipes
and all large pipes should have separators and steam traps.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Pumps that are generally operated at moderately high
speeds and with high lifts may be made to work more smoothly
by placing a <em>vacuum chamber on the suction pipe</em>.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>Valves in the suction pipe</em> should have the stems carefully
packed and kept tight; air leaks in valve stem stuffing-boxes
are too often overlooked.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>Stoppage of the suction pipes</em> or chamber is generally indicated
by a jerky action and pounding of the plungers or water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
pistons, while a dull thud at the ends of the stroke is more
often due to a lack of air in the air chamber, or when the speed
is high, to a lack of capacity in the air chamber.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>The steam ends of pumps</em> require the same lubrication as the
cylinders and valves of engines. Intermittent lubrication is
never to be recommended even for slow running pumps. Sight
feed oil cups are always preferred.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>A sight feed lubricator</em> connected to the steam pipe below
the throttle or to the steam chest is <em>automatic in its operation</em>.
All that is necessary is to fill it. When the speed increases
the feed increases and when the pump stops the feed stops.
An oil hand pump is also desirable to introduce a mixture of
oil and graphite, about 10 per cent. of graphite.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>The water end stuffing-boxes of a pump</em> may be lubricated
by putting a heavy grease on the piston rods, or good cylinder
oil may be used when grease is not at hand. <em>Some of the grease
works into the stuffing-boxes</em> and furnishes better lubrication
than can be obtained by the water alone. Care must be used
not to use too much oil as it must not go beyond the stuffing-boxes
and contaminate the water.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>When a pump works properly under high pressures and fails
to work under low pressures, the difficulty is generally found
<em>in the lift of the valves</em>.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>When the water end of a pump</em> is known to be in good condition
failure to run properly will in all probability be discovered
<em>in the steam end</em>, and in single cylinder pumps the fault is
generally caused by clogging of the auxiliary valves and ports.
Sometimes pieces of packing break off and get into these small
ports, thus shutting off the admission or release of steam.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>When one side of a duplex pump</em> makes a quick stroke it indicates
either that the stuffing-box gland of the opposite side
is too tight or that the packing in the cylinder of the side making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
the quick stroke is wearing out or has, perhaps, given way.
A broken discharge or suction valve will also cause a “jerky“
motion of the pistons.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Pumps should be examined frequently in order <em>to know
what parts are beginning to wear</em> and how fast the wear is taking
place. When this is done the worn parts can, in the
majority of cases, be taken out and replaced by new ones before
they give out entirely, thus avoiding delay, but what is
better, <em>duplicated parts kept on hand</em> ready at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>The regular inspection <em>of the screen in the separating chamber</em>
in the suction pipe renders frequent inspections of the interior
of the pump unnecessary, the inspection previously alluded to
is generally easier and more quickly done.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>Considerable wear can and frequently does take place in a
pump</em> in the course of six months, and for this reason it is advisable
to inspect the interiors at shorter intervals, say four
months for general service pumps and once in three months for
boiler feed pumps. More frequent inspections should be made
when handling dirty water.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>When a pump has to run faster one week than the week
previous</em> in order to supply approximately an equal volume of
water, the plungers and valves should be examined, because
such behavior indicates leakage.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>The sight feed lubricator should be filled in the morning</em> so
as to be empty by night, thus permitting the water to be
drained out without wasting oil. Draining the delivery valve
chest will also drain the delivery pipe up to the check valve if
those pipes are above the chest and without water seals in
them. If this pipe is arranged below the pump, then separate
drain cocks should be provided and should be placed at the
lowest positions in the piping.</p>

<p><em>When a pump fails to start after standing for some time</em> it
should be primed by filling the barrel with water and starting
the pump slowly. If after priming it fails to raise water, the
suction pipe should be examined and also the plungers and
the valves. If the plunger packing has become dry and hard,
merely filling the water end with water will not at once remedy
the trouble because the packing must be thoroughly soaked
before it will work properly.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>Pumps should be packed with the same care and consideration
as is used with the best steam engines.</em> The rods should be
packed just tight enough to prevent leakage, and the packing
renewed often enough to keep it soft and pliable, in which state
it readily absorbs oil. Old packing will upon examination be
frequently found full of sand and small particles of grit.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>Metallic packings</em> are now extensively used on steam piston
rods and upon the rods of air pumps.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>When priming and draining a pump</em> the air cock in the air
chamber should also be opened. The drain and cylinder cocks
at the steam end should be opened before closing the throttle;
the steam should be shut off at the boiler when stopping at
night so as to drain the entire pipe.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>Pumps that are exposed to low temperatures in winter</em>
should be provided with removable drain plugs or drain cocks
for emptying the cylinders and valve chambers of water and
also allowing the water to flow out of the suction pipe.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>The friction in pipes</em>, whether of cast iron, steel or copper,
depends upon the internal smoothness of the pipe and the
velocity of the water, as well as the number and kind of ells,
tees and valves in the pipe. Wrought iron lap welded pipe,
for steam, is preferable to either cast iron or copper. It is
smoother internally than cast iron, and is lighter and costs less
than copper, and is much stronger and safer than either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<p>It may be said when an engine is run without a condenser
the steam with which the cylinder is filled at the end of the
stroke <em>has to be forced out against the pressure of the atmosphere</em>,
about 15 pounds to the square inch. It is possible from the
nature of steam to remove the atmospheric pressure with a
decided gain in almost all cases.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>One pound of steam at atmospheric pressure</em> occupies 1,642
times as much room as it does in the state of water. If, therefore,
when the stroke has been completed, and we are ready for
the piston to come back, we inject a little cold water into the
spent steam, it will condense to about one 1600th of its volume,
and leave a vacuum into which the piston can return without
having to force back the atmosphere. This is the way the
earlier vertical engines were run, the condensation taking place
in the cylinder itself, and, moreover, the vacuum was all that
made the engine operative, for the steam carried was but little
above atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>The velocity of water entering a suction pipe</em> depends upon
two things, the vacuum in the pipe and the vertical lift of the
water. The longer the suction pipe, vertically, the greater the
frictional resistance to the flow of water; the flow of water
through small discharge pipes should not exceed four hundred
feet per minute, and for large pipes five hundred feet per
minute.</p>

<p><em>A locomotive-boiler compound.</em> The lines of a certain great
R. R. traverse a country where the water is very hard and they
are compelled to resort to some method of precipitating the
lime that is held in solution. After many tests and experiments
they have made a compound and use it as follows: in a barrel
of water of a capacity of fifty gallons they put 21 lbs. of carbonate
of soda, or best white soda ash of commerce, and 35 lbs.
of white caustic soda; the cost, per gallon, is about 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cents.
The compound is carried in this concentrated form, in calomine
cans on the tender of each locomotive. A certain amount,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
according to the necessities of the case, is poured into the tender
at the water tank at each filling. This amount is determined
by analysis, and varies all the way from two to fifteen
pints for two thousand gallons of water. The precipitating
power of this compound may be taken roughly at <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of a pound
of the carbonate of lime, or equivalent amount of other material,
per pint of the compound. On their western lines where they
are dealing with alkali waters and those containing sulphates,
the company use merely 60 pounds of soda ash to a barrel of
water. When the water is pumped into the boiler the heat
completes the precipitation and aggregation of the particles,
and this does away with all trouble of the boiler or injector
tubes clogging up.</p>

<p>It has been recently determined by some German experimenters
that <em>sugar effects a strong action in steam boilers</em>; it has
an acid reaction upon the iron which dissolves it with a disengagement
of hydrogen. The amount of damage done increases
with the amount of sugar in the water. These results are worthy
of note in sugar refineries and places where sugar sometimes
finds its way into the boilers by means of the water supplied.
The experiments in question also show that zinc is strongly attacked
by sugar; copper, tin, lead and aluminium are not
attacked.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>White oak bark, used by tanners</em>, has an excellent effect on
boiler incrustations. It may be used as follows: Throw into
the tank or reservoir from which the boilers are fed a quantity
of bark in the piece, in sufficient quantity to turn the water to
a light brown color. Repeat this operation every month at
least, using only half the quantity after the first month. Add
a very small quantity of the muriate of ammonia, about one
pound for every 2,000 gallons of water used. This will have
the effect of softening as well as disintegrating the carbonate of
lime and other impurities deposited by the action of evaporation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Care must be exercised in keeping the bark, as it becomes
broken up, from the pump valves and blow-off valves. This may be accomplished
by throwing it into the reservoir confined in a sack.</p></div>

<p><em>Among the best samples of boiler compounds</em> ever sent to the
laboratory for analysis were those found to be composed of:</p>

<p>This solution was formerly sold at a good round figure, but
since its nature became more generally known, it is not found
in the market, but it is largely used, consumers putting it up
in lots sufficient to last a year or so at a time.</p>

<p>The above is strongly recommended by those who have
used it, one pound of the mixture being added to each barrel
of water used, but after the scale is once thoroughly removed
from the boiler, the use of sal-soda is all that is necessary.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>There are other evils sometimes inherent in hard waters</em>
above the mere production of a crust. Some waters contain
a great deal of soluble magnesia salts, together with common
salt. When this is the case there is a great probability of
corrosion, for the former is attacked by steam at high pressure
in such a way that muriatic acid fumes are produced, which
seriously corrode the boiler, and what is far worse, passes with
the steam into the engine, and sets up corrosion in the cylinders
and other delicate fittings with which the steam comes
in contact. All this can, however, be obviated by the removal
of the magnesia from the water.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p><em>When water attains a high temperature</em>, as it does under increasing
pressure, ranging from 175&deg; to about 420&deg; Fahr., all carbonates,
sulphates and chlorides are deposited in the following
order:</p>

<p>First. Carbonate of lime at 176&deg; and 248&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>Second. Sulphate of lime at 248&deg; and 420&deg;.</p>

<p>Third. Magnesia, or chlorides of magnesium, at 324&deg; and 364&deg;.</p>

<p>It is to take advantage of this fact that mechanically arranged
jets, sprinklers and long perforated pipes are introduced
into the interior of a steam boiler; these tend to scatter the
depositing impurities and also to bring the feed water more
quickly to the highest possible temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span></p>

<p><em>Where fuel is expensive</em> and pumps are used for continuous
service under high and unusually high pressures it is
oftentimes advisable to operate the pumps condensing. This
may be done, when the pump lifts water by suction, without a
separate condenser by connecting the exhaust pipe with the
suction pipe, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_667">667</a>. Assume that the pump
has been working properly for from 3 to 5 minutes with
the valve <em>A</em> nearly closed and the valve <em>B</em> a little open, the
valve <em>A</em> is now quickly closed and <em>B</em> opened. In operating
these valves both hands should be used, so that they may be
opened and closed simultaneously.</p>

<p><em>So penetrating is water at high pressure</em> that only special
qualities of cast iron will be tight against it. In the early days
of the hydraulic jack it was no uncommon thing to see water
issuing like a fine needle through the metal, and the water needle
is said to penetrate the flesh as readily as one of steel.</p>

<p>The engraving, Fig. <a href="#fig_668">668</a>, represents a novel device for
<em>preventing the bursting of water pipes by freezing</em>. This is
simply an air chamber placed in the horizontal part of the
pipe, with the chamber on top side so that the ice may expand
into this chamber, and so its force is expended upon the air
instead of bursting the pipe.</p>

<p>This device also acts as an air chamber and prevents
“water hammer.” It is made by the Anti-bursting pipe Co.,
Pittsburg, Pa.</p>

<p><em>When it becomes necessary</em> to make a quick connection
into a main steam pipe without breaking joints, a saddle such
as either of those shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_669">669</a> and Fig. <a href="#fig_670">670</a> may be applied
by simply cutting or drilling a hole through the main steam
pipe.</p>

<p><em>To make the joint</em>, the rough lumps should be filed off the
outside of the pipe and red lead rubbed on to mark the surface,
to show when the fit is properly made. Then lay on
with a brush a thin mixture of red lead and varnish and
quickly screw the saddle in place. Such joints seldom or never
leak when allowed to thoroughly dry before use.</p>

<p>When it becomes necessary to cut square packing to reduce
its depth, place the packing in a vise, allowing the stock to be
removed to project above the jaws, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_671">671</a>.
With the aid of a draw-knife the work can be quickly and
easily done. It is difficult to cut the packing evenly. If the
rings have an uneven bearing on the bottom of the grooves
leakage is likely to occur when the pump is first started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span></p>

<p><em>The follower type of water piston</em> can readily be packed
without removing it from the cylinder, providing rings of the
proper depth and length are at hand. The old packing rings
can be removed with a packing hook. Take the new ring and
start one end with a soft stick, and push the remainder of the
ring firmly against the collar or flange at the inner end of the
piston, as shown in the engraving, Fig. <a href="#fig_672">672</a>. Arrange the
several rings so as to break joints.</p>

<p><em>Method of packing a follower piston.</em> Coat the sides of the
rings with a thick paste of cylinder oil and <em>Dixon’s Flake</em>
graphite, which will prevent the rings from sticking together.</p>

<p><em>Pump packing cannot be readily examined</em> and is liable to
fail at any time, therefore several rings, cut to the proper
length, should be kept on hand. This may be easily done by
making a pattern ring, which is nothing more or less than a
ring of packing which has been fitted into the piston and is
known to be of the proper length. The extra rings can then be
cut at odd times, and when occasion demands it the water
piston can be packed very quickly and the pump started.</p>

<p>Care should be taken when about to pack a boiler feed
pump or other pump subjected to high pressure to see that the
cylinders are relieved before loosening the cylinder head bolts.
This may be accomplished by closing the valve in the delivery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
pipe, and also in the suction pipe; if the pump receives water
under pressure, open the air cock on the air chamber and
cylinder cocks.</p>

<p><em>Pump slip or slippage</em> represents the difference between the
calculated and the actual discharge of a pump, which is generally
expressed as a percentage of the calculated discharge. Thus, when the
slippage is given as fifteen per cent. it indicates that the loss due
to slip amounts to fifteen per cent. of the calculated discharge.
Slippage is due to two causes, the time required for the suction and
discharge valve to seat, due to excessive speed. When the piston
speed is so high that the water cannot enter the pump fast enough to
completely fill the cylinder only a partial cylinder full of water is
delivered at each stroke. High speeds also increase slippage, due to
the seating of the valves.</p>

<p><em>Graphite as a lubricant</em> is almost without a rival. It is one of
the forms under which carbon appears in nature; it is also known under
the name of <em>plumbago</em> and <em>black lead</em>; it is soft and oily to the
touch; it is a conductor of electricity; it is a lubricant that allows
pipe joints to be screwed up to the tightest possible fit. Graphite
remains upon the threads preventing rust, and it so preserves its
peculiar properties that pipe can be unscrewed without effort eight or
ten years after the joints have been made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span></p>

<p><em>It is difficult to lift hot water by suction, but not everyone
can explain the cause</em>; the reason is as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="figs_673_674">
<img src="images/i_p385.jpg" width="256" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 673 and 674.</span></p></div>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#figs_673_674">674</a>, let A be a vessel in which a vacuum exists, and
let it communicate by a tube, as shown, to the lower vessel
containing water. The pressure of the atmosphere upon the
surface will force the water up into the pipe
until the column is high enough to exert a
pressure per square inch equal to that of the
atmosphere. A cubic inch of water weighs
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub> of a pound, so that it will take 28 cubic inches to
weigh a pound, or a column 28 inches high to exert a pressure
of one pound per square inch. The atmospheric pressure is 14.7
pounds, or to avoid fractions, say, 15 pounds. This pressure
would then support a column (15 &times; 28)/12 = 35 feet high; that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
the column <em>a-c</em> in Fig. <a href="#figs_673_674">674</a> would be 35 feet in height. Attach
a gauge at or above the top, <em>a</em>, of a column, and it will indicate
a perfect vacuum; if the gauge were attached 28 inches
below <em>a</em>, it would indicate a pressure of one pound above absolute
zero, or a vacuum of 15-1 = 14 pounds; and if the
gauge were moved further downward, it would indicate an increasing
pressure, that is, a diminishing vacuum, at the rate of
one pound for every 28 inches of the water column above it,
until at the level of the water in the tank the pressure would
be 15 pounds absolute, and the vacuum would be zero.</p>

<p>Now, suppose the pipe to be lowered until the distance
from the bottom of the vessel, A, to the water level, <em>c</em>, is 21
feet. In that case we will have the pressure of the atmosphere
(15 pounds) forcing the water up into the vessel, and the
column 21 feet high, or (21 &times; 12)/28 = 9 pounds, opposing it. The
difference, 15-9 = 6 pounds, is available to force the water
into the chamber. This arrangement is shown in Fig. <a href="#figs_673_674">673</a>,
where A is a pump cylinder; then the difference in pressure,
6 pounds, lifts the valve, and the water enters the pump chamber
with a velocity due to that pressure. In order to insure
smooth and quiet running of the pump, it is necessary to keep
the speed of the piston inside of the velocity with which the
cylinder would fill under this pressure, reduced by the friction
of the water, the pressure required to lift the valves, etc.</p>

<p>But this supposes that there is a perfect vacuum in A, and
we cannot realize this in contact with hot water. Water at any
temperature will boil unless it is under a pressure equal to or
greater than that corresponding with the temperature. Water
at 60 degrees F. will boil if the pressure upon its surface is reduced
to a quarter of a pound per square inch, and in the case
shown in Fig. <a href="#figs_673_674">674</a>, it would boil and fill the space A with
steam at that absolute pressure.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Water at 170 degrees F. will boil if its pressure is reduced below
6 pounds absolute, and if the water were at this temperature in Fig. <a href="#figs_673_674">673</a>, the
cylinder, A, would be filled with steam at 6 pounds pressure; and this added
to the 9 pounds pressure of the column would completely balance the atmospheric
pressure, and the water would not rise above the level, A.</p></div>

<h3>TABLES AND DATA.</h3></div>

<p><em>Miner’s Inch Measurement.</em> <em>The term miner’s inch</em> is of
California origin, and not known or used in any other locality,
it being a method of measurement adopted by the various ditch
companies in disposing of water to their customers. The term is
more or less indefinite for the reason that the water companies
do not all use the same head above the center of the aperture,
and the inch varies from 1.36 to 1.73 cubic feet per minute
each, but the most common measurement is through an
aperture 2 inches high and whatever length is required, and
through a plank 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches thick, as shown in the engraving,
Fig. <a href="#fig_675">675</a>. The lower edge of the aperture should be 2 inches
above the bottom of the measuring box, and the plank 5 inches
high above the aperture, thus making a 6-inch head above the
center of the stream. Each square inch of this opening represents
a miner’s inch, which is equal to a flow of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cubic
feet per minute. Time is not to be considered in any calculation
based upon a miner’s inch measurement.</p>

<p><em>Explanation of Weir Dam Measurement.</em> Place a board or
plank edgewise across the stream to be measured as illustrated
in Fig. <a href="#fig_676">676</a>.</p>

<p>This plank will be supported by posts sufficiently strong to
resist the pressure likely to be brought upon it by the head of
water which will form in the pond above this temporary dam,
saw out a gap in the top of the dam whose length should be
from two to four times its depth for small quantities of water
and longer for larger quantities. The edges of this gap should
be beveled toward the intake as represented. The over-fall
below the bottom of gap should be not less than twice its
depth, that is, twelve inches if the gap is six inches deep, etc.</p>

<p>Drive a stake above the dam at a distance of about six feet
from the face of the plank and then obstruct the water until it rises
precisely to the bottom of the gap and mark the water level on
the stake. Complete the dam so that all the water will be compelled
to flow through the gap and when the stream has assumed
a regular flow mark the stake at this new level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span></p>

<p>Some would prefer to drive the stake with its top precisely
level with the bottom edge of gap in dam so that the depth of
water in stream may be measured with a rule or steel square
placed upon top of this stake at any time after the flow of water
has reached its average depth over dam. However the marks
upon the stake are preferred by most experts. After the stake
has been marked it may be withdrawn and the distance between
the first and last marks gives the theoretical flow according to
the table, page 391.</p>

<p><em>Measurement in an open stream by velocity and cross section.</em>
Measure the depth of the water at from 6 to 12 places across
the stream at equal distances apart. Add together all the
depths in feet and divide by the number of measurements made;
this will be the average depth of the stream, which, multiplied
by its width, will give its area or cross section. Multiply this
by the velocity of the stream in feet per minute which gives
the cubic feet per minute of the stream.</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
